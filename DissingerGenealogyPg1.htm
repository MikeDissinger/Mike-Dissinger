<p><b><font face="Tahoma">I just want to make a personal note here.... since 
I've been doing research on the Dissinger clan meaning I was researching births 
and deaths and walking through various cemeteries and looking at tomb stone that 
are so old you could barely read the birth and death dates on them and I look at 
then knowing that these old old tomb stone and their occupants probably haven't 
seen any relatives/love ones in years as there probably just aren't any 
relatives/loves ones left anymore. No one is coming by anymore to place flowers 
or just to say &quot;Hi, we loved you and miss you&quot;. It made me sad. So many 
forgotten lives that meant so much to others on days gone by, but now to no one. 
It is like they never really existed and no one really cares if they did or 
didn't. What a Pity.</font></b></p>
