<font face="Tahoma" size="4">I don't know who the back left person is. The back
right person is my Grandfather Harry White Hummer. The person in the foreground
would of been my my Uncle Johnny (my Grandfather Harry White Hummer's brother).
I remember my mother (Annabelle Hummer/Dissinger) telling me about my Uncle
Johnny, saying he was mentally challenged but she didn't go into any detail and
it was a long time ago, so I don't know if I've remembered everything she might
have told me. My half Aunt Darlene Longenecker saying likewise. Per the
&quot;Manheim Revisited Compiled &amp; Edited By The Manheim Historical
Society&quot; book... &quot;Many Manheim natives will remember Johnny Hummer. He
pushed his two-wheeled cart all over town as he gathered papers and junk&quot;.
The handwriting on the photo is Mom's handwriting stating that the 'Johnny' on
the picture was Harry White Hummers brother not her brother 'Johnny'.</font><p>

NOTE 10/13/2013 I previously said that I though the person in the back row right
end was my Uncle Earl, as it looked like him, but after thinking about this it
could not have been him as he probably wasn't even born yet or at the very least
he would of been very young, so this also makes me also think that the two kids

other people were.&nbsp; No clue where this photo
