	anything on Mom's left hand. Her ring was very thin so it is possible I just 
	can't see her ring. 
	<img border="0" src="spotting.gif" width="32" height="32">&nbsp; And due to the fact that they are both in a position

	10/13/2013 I previously said that I though the person in the back row right

	it could not have been him as he probably wasn't even born yet or at the

	that the two kids in the front row are probably my Mom (Annabelle

	No clue where this photo was take at.</font></p>

	Not (Annabelle Hummer/Dissinger's brother Johnny Hummer (my Uncle Johnny)) and Anna Mae Mill. I have

    (38) Per the note on the back of this photo, written in my Mom's 
	handwriting, this is (from left to right) Her Mom (Mabel Anna Hoffer/Hummer) 
	Pop Hosler and Mrs. Heisey. I know Mom spoke about the Hosler's, but other 
	than them owning/running a restaurant at one time, I don't know how they fit 
	into the Hummer/Dissinger relationship. I know Harry White Hummer bought the 
	restaurant at some point and then Elmer Longnecker bought or took over the restaurant 
	when Harry White Hummer died. Mrs. Heisey I don't know who she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 I'm 
	really guessing here and I have nothing to substantiate it, but I'm 
	wondering if the Hosler's were my Grandmother's MOTHER'S maiden name?<br>
    As of 7/18/2016 I spoke to Jim Hosler (thanks for all the information Jim!)
    and he said my Grandmother's Mother was NOT a Hosler.&nbsp; He also stated
    that my Mom (Annabelle Hummer/Dissinger) used to spend a lot of time at the
    Hosler's and that is where the Hosler's fit into the picture.&nbsp; I found
    out a bit later that Mom's Grandmother Alice's maiden name was Miller.</font></p>

    Grandfather's (Harry White Hummer's) parents and Brother's tombstone but I'm
    not 100% sure.&nbsp; I know Harry White Hummer's brothers name was <u>John W</u>illiams
    Hummer so the &quot;<u>John W</u>.&quot; on the tombstone fits and I'm reasonably
    sure Harry White Hummer's Fathers name was Samuel, but I've got nothing on
    Harry White Hummer's Mothers name, which on the tombstone is showing as
    &quot;Lizzie&quot;.&nbsp; Per &quot;Find A Grave&quot;, memorial site
    memorial # 154639543, Lizzie's middle name is showing as &quot;<u>Williams</u>&quot;
    so that fits with &quot;John <u>Williams</u> Hummer&quot;.&nbsp; And also
    per &quot;Find A Grave&quot; her actual birth date was 5/9/1870 and died on
    10/15/1940).&nbsp; Sooo maybe right or may be wrong..<br>
    <br>
    As of 7/27/2016 I've found that this picture IS THE CORRECT TOMBSTONE for my
    Great Grandparents and my Uncle John Williams Hummer.<br>
    I've come to this realization due to the fact that I've just re-looked at my
    Grandfather's death certificate and IT states that his Father's name was
    Samuel and his Mother's name was Lizzie Williams/Hummer.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Further investigations found that Lizzie and Samuel had 7
    children, per the 1990 census I found.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were...<br>
    Amos born 1876<br>
    Katie born 1878<br>
    Lizzie born 1880<br>
    Clarah born 1881 twins I'm guessing here<br>
    Samuel born 1881 twins I'm guessing here<br>
    Sarah born 1886<br>
    Harry born 1890 - My Grandfather Harry White Hummer, although the census
    shows birthday as 1890 where other records show it as 1891.<br>
    At time time of this 1900 census John Williams Hummer evidently has not yet
    been born.&nbsp; He is born IN 1900, however.</font></p>
