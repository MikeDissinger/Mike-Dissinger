Recipe Name:BAKED CHICKEN BREAST<br>
11/01/2009<br>
The secret to juicy chicken breasts? Bake for a short time at a high temperature.&nbsp;<br>
Baking for 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees F will yield dry meat. But baking for just&nbsp;<br>
20 minutes at 450 degrees F will result in delightfully juicy chicken breasts, every time.<br>
Makes 2 servings<br>
Total time: 30 minutes<br>
Ingredients<br>
2 raw boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 1 lb total weight)<br>
Olive oil cooking spray<br>
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon Freshly ground black pepper<br>
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon onion powder<br>
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
1/4 teaspoon thyme<br>
1/4 teaspoon rosemary<br>
1/4 teaspoon paprika<br>
Directions<br>
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking dish with foil and spray&nbsp;<br>
it with olive oil nonstick spray.<br>
2. Spray both sides of each chicken breast half with olive oil spray and&nbsp;<br>
sprinkle with the seasonings. Bake for 10 minutes, flip to the other side,&nbsp;<br>
lightly spray again and bake for 8-10 more minutes, or until juices run clear&nbsp;<br>
when pierced with a fork (it’s fine to make a small slit in the thickest part&nbsp;<br>
and see if it’s done!).<br>
Sometimes I get really large chicken breasts at the store – total weight 2&nbsp;<br>
pounds – in this case I find that baking them 15 minutes on each side is&nbsp;<br>
just right. Of course, the best way to make sure they are done is to use an&nbsp;<br>
instant-read thermometer. It should read 165 degreed F when inserted into&nbsp;<br>
the thickest part.<br>
3. Transfer to a platter. Loosely cover with foil and allow to rest 5 minutes before slicing.&nbsp;<br>

Total Time: 21 minutes<br>
Ingredients:<br>
skinless chicken breasts<br>
1 egg<br>
seasoned bread crumbs<br>
canola oil<br>

2. Set out three shallow pie dishes or deep plates: one with flour, one with beaten egg, one&nbsp;<br>
with seasoned bread crumbs.<br>
3. Make sure your boneless, skinless chicken breasts are thin by either slicing them in half&nbsp;<br>
or pounding them flatter.<br>
3A. *First sprinkle both sides of chicken with mixture of kosher sale, ground black pepper, garlic powder,&nbsp;<br>
onion powder, oregano and paprika.<br>
4. Dip the chicken first into flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the egg, shaking&nbsp;<br>
off any excess. Finally, dip it into the seasoned bread crumbs.<br>

over each chicken piece.<br>
6. Then bake for 6-8 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is white in the middle. Bake&nbsp;<br>
time depends on the thickness of the chicken.<br>
Tips:<br>
1. Use well seasoned bread crumbs so the cutlets will be tasty.<br>
2. Be careful not to over bake so the cutlets will be moist.<br>

Recipe Name:BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 (3 1/2 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces<br>
2 cups buttermilk<br>
Salt &amp; pepper<br>
Vegetable oil, for frying<br>
1 cup self-rising flour (or add 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking power and 1/4 teaspoon salt to AP flour)<br>
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika<br>
Freshly ground pepper<br>
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
====================================<br>
per KFC their spice ingredients<br>
1 teaspoon dried sage<br>
1 teaspoon dried basil<br>
1 teaspoon dried marjoram<br>
1 teaspoon pepper<br>
2 teaspoons salt<br>
2 Tablespoons paprika<br>
1 Tablespoon onion salt<br>
1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
2 Tablespoons Accent (MSG seasoning)<br>
1 teaspoon ground oregano<br>
1 teaspoon chili powder<br>
====================================<br>
Directions<br>
Toss the chicken, buttermilk and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 1 hour (up to 8 hours).  Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360. &lt;---- very difficult. I ended up eyeballing it and all but burnt it!  Might be better in deep fryer?  Mix the flour, paprika, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Remove the dark meat from the buttermilk, shake off the excess and roll in the flour mixture. Shake off the excess flour, place in the hot oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 15 minutes (adjust the heat as needed). Drain on paper towels.<br>

Stir the remaining milk, egg and baking mix in a small bowl.  Spread the batter on the chicken mixture.<br>
bake for 30 minutes on until the topping is golden brown.<br>
Was good, but could of used celery and potatoes.  The Bisquick top crust... it was brown but<br>
just not totally baked... probably could of used another 10 minutes or so.  I also put some saffron in with mix.<br>

Recipe Name:Chicken &amp; Dumplings<br>
11/01/2009<br>
I got this recipe from Millie<br>
4 chicken breast halves (1 1/2 lbs. total )<br>
2 1/2 c. water<br>
1 med. onion, sliced and separated into rings<br>
1 t. instant chicken bouillon granules<br>
1 t. snipped fresh thyme or 1/4 t. dried thyme, crushed<br>
1/4 t. black pepper<br>
2 c. sliced carrots (4 med.)<br>
1 med. bulb fennel, cut into bite-size strips (1 1/2 c.)<br>
1/4 c. cold water<br>
2 T. cornstarch<br>
1 recipe Dumplings (below)<br>
Remove skin from chicken.  In a large saucepan combine the chicken pieces, the 2 1/2 c. water, the onion, bouillon granules, dried thyme (if using), and pepper.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 25 min.  Add carrots and fennel.  Return to boiling and reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 10 min. more.<br>
Remove chicken pieces from saucepan; set aside.  Skim fat from broth in pan.<br>
In a small bowl stir together the 1/4 c. cold water and cornstarch; stir into broth in saucepan.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Return chicken to pan; add fresh thyme (if using).<br>
Drop dumplings batter from a tablespoon into 8 mounds onto the hot chicken mixture.  Cover; simmer about 10 min. or until a wooden toothpick inserted in to a dumpling comes out clean.<br>
DUMPLINGS:<br>
In a small bowl stir together 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 t. baking powder, 1/8 t.<br>
salt, and 1/8 t. coarsely ground black pepper.  In another small bowl, stir together 1 beaten egg, 1/4 c. fat-free milk, and 1 T. cooking oil.<br>
Pour into flour mixture; stir with a fork until combined.<br>
It smelled fantastic as it was cooking, but actually wasn't all that great :(  I had cut the recipe quanties in half as I didn't want to do 4 chicken breast halves as the recipe called for.<br>
and it was way too dry... should of had more bulk to the liquid part, perhaps, if I make it again, add more water and another chicken bouillon granule.<br>

Recipe Name:Chicken And Slicks<br>
04/18/2013<br>
per http://www.cookscountry.com/tv<br>
Why this recipe works:<br>
Replacing water with canned chicken broth was a no-brainer and provided a flavorful base for our Chicken and Slicks recipe. Rather than throw chicken parts into simmering broth, we browned them first to boost flavor. We used both white and dark meat to please tasters who preferred each, and stuck to bone-in pieces for the best flavor. We replaced the lard in our slicks with more readily available vegetable oil as well as some of the rendered fat from our chicken.<br>
Cooking the slicks in an already thickened broth caused them to break apart. To solve the problem, we cooked the slicks in the unthickened broth before adding toasted flour to thicken it. Briefly freezing the slicks before cooking them in the broth further helped prevent them from breaking apart.<br>
Watch the Video From our TV Show Watch This Recipe Season 5: Dixie Chicken<br>
Serves 4 to 6<br>
If you’re short on chicken fat at the end of step 1, supplement it with vegetable oil.<br>
Ingredients<br>
3 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds), excess fat trimmed<br>
2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds), halved crosswise<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
2 cups plus 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>
3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
1 onion, chopped<br>
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme<br>
7 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
1/4 cup Chopped fresh parsley<br>
Instructions<br>
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Toast 6 tablespoons flour in Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring constantly, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer flour to medium bowl and wipe out pot. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook chicken until well browned all over, about 10 minutes; transfer to plate. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin. Pour fat (you should have about 2 tablespoons) into another small bowl; reserve.<br>
2. Add onion and 1 tablespoon oil to now-empty pot and cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 7 cups broth, chicken, and bay leaves and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until white meat registers 160 degrees and dark meat registers 175 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer chicken to clean plate. When chicken is cool enough to handle, shred into bite-size pieces, discarding bones.<br>
3. Meanwhile, combine remaining chicken broth, reserved fat, and remaining oil in liquid measuring cup. Process remaining flour and ½ teaspoon salt in food processor until combined. With machine running, slowly pour in broth mixture and process until mixture resembles coarse meal. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Divide in half.<br>
4. Following photos 1 to 3, roll each dough half into 10-inch square. Cut each square into twenty 5 by 1-inch rectangles. Place handful of noodles in single layer on parchment-lined plate, cover with another sheet of parchment, and repeat stacking with remaining noodles and additional parchment, ending with parchment. Freeze until firm, at least 10 minutes or up to 30 minutes.<br>
5. Return broth to simmer and add noodles. Cook until noodles are nearly tender, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to separate. Remove 1 cup broth from pot and whisk into reserved toasted flour. Stir broth-flour mixture into pot, being careful not to break up noodles, and simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken and parsley and cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.&nbsp;<br>
Serve.<br>
MAKE AHEAD Broth and chicken can be made through step 2 and refrigerated in separate airtight containers for 2 days. Dough can be made through step 3, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for 1 day. To finish, proceed with step 4.<br>
Fat Is Where the Flavor Is<br>
RENDERED CHICKEN FAT<br>
We bumped up the flavor of the slicks by using chicken broth and rendered chicken fat in the dough.<br>
Sure, making slicks requires a little time (although we minimize it by making the dough in the food processor). But the delicious result is definitely worth a bit of effort.<br>
1. After kneading the dough briefly, roll each dough half into a 10-inch square of 1/8 inch thickness.<br>
2. Using a sharp knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough into 5 by 1-inch rectangles.<br>
3. Stack the slicks between layers of parchment and freeze briefly before simmering.<br>
Toasted Flour Slurry<br>
Flour-thickened stews usually start with a roux of flour cooked in fat to cook off the floury taste. But when we tried starting this recipe with a roux, the slicks failed to cook through in the viscous simmering broth. If we turned up the heat, they broke apart. If we added the flour at the end, our dinner tasted like raw flour. Finally, we got the idea to dry-toast the flour on the stovetop to cook off its raw flavor. We combined the toasted flour with broth to make a slurry, which we stirred into the pot once the slicks were tender at the end of cooking.<br>

Recipe Name:CHICKEN BREAST FENNEL ROSEMARY<br>
04/21/2013<br>
Sautéed Chicken Breasts with Fennel and Rosemary&nbsp;<br>
TOTAL TIME: 35 MIN<br>
SERVINGS: 4<br>

Recipe Name:Chicken Croquettes Oven Fried<br>
07/10/2013<br>
Cook Time: 40 minutes<br>
Total Time: 40 minutes<br>
Ingredients:<br>
5 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided<br>
3 tablespoons flour<br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
1/2 cup chicken broth<br>
2 cups finely chopped cooked chicken<br>
1 1/4 cups fine dry bread crumbs, divided<br>
3 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley or 1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
2 eggs, lightly beaten<br>
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
Preparation:<br>
Directions for chicken croquettes<br>
In a medium saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter or margarine over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes without browning. Gradually whisk in milk and broth; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth and thickened. Remove from heat; let cool 5 to 10 minutes. In large bowl, combine chicken, 1 cup bread crumbs,  parsley, salt and eggs. Mix well. Pour in sauce, blend well.   Cover and chill for about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350°. Combine Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Shape chicken croquettes mixture into 2 1/2-inch balls, then roll to form oval shapes; makes about 8.&nbsp;<br>
Roll shaped croquettes in bread crumb mixture. Arrange in a greased 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzle over chicken croquettes. (Mike note, DON'T drizzle over the croquettes, but rather melt butt in small pan and roll the croquettes in it.)  Bake chicken croquettes 30 minutes until golden brown. They didn't really get brown, so perhaps needed to be baked more?<br>
They weren't all that great, maybe with some onions?  but just not a lot of taste.<br>

Prep:5 min<br>
Cook:11 min<br>
Yield:10 servings<br>
Level:Easy<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 pound penne<br>
Salt<br>
4 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size chunks<br>
Ground pepper<br>
2 tablespoons butter<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
3/4 cup low-sodium broth, more if needed<br>
3/4 cup dry white wine<br>
1 bag baby spinach<br>
2 cups grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise<br>
4 ounces Parmesan, shaved with a vegetable peeler, plus more for serving<br>
Directions<br>
Cook the pasta according to package directions in lightly salted water. Drain and set aside.<br>
Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and olive oil over high heat in a large skillet.&nbsp;<br>
Add the chicken chunks in a single layer and do not stir for a minute or two in order to allow the chicken to brown on the first side. Flip the chicken and brown on the other side. Cook until done, and then remove the chicken from the skillet.<br>
Turn the heat to medium. Add the garlic and quickly stir to avoid burning. After about 30 seconds, pour in the broth and wine, stirring to deglaze the skillet. Allow the liquid to bubble up, and then continue cooking until it's reduced by at least half (most of the surface of the liquid should be bubbling at this point).<br>
Turn off the heat. Add the spinach, tomatoes, chicken, cooked pasta and Parmesan shavings to the skillet.&nbsp;<br>
Toss to combine; the spinach will wilt as you toss everything.<br>
Add more Parmesan shavings and serve immediately! Serve with extra Parmesan shavings.<br>

Recipe Name:CHICKEN MARSALA<br>
09/19/2013<br>
Ingredients<br>
4 skinless, boneless, chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)<br>
All-purpose flour, for dredging<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>
4 ounces prosciutto, thinly sliced (Italian ham)<br>
8 ounces crimini or porcini mushrooms, stemmed and halved<br>
1/2 cup sweet Marsala wine<br>
1/2 cup chicken stock<br>
2 tablespoon unsalted butter<br>
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley<br>
Directions<br>
Put the chicken breasts side by side on a cutting board and lay a piece of plastic wrap over them; pound with a flat meat mallet, until they are about 1/4-inch thick. Put some flour in a shallow platter and season with a fair amount of salt and pepper; mix with a fork to distribute evenly.<br>
Heat the oil over medium-high flame in a large skillet. When the oil is nice and hot, dredge both sides of the chicken cutlets in the seasoned flour, shaking off the excess. Slip the cutlets into the pan and fry for 5 minutes on each side until golden, turning once – do this in batches if the pieces don't fit comfortably in the pan. Remove the chicken to a large platter in a single layer to keep warm.<br>
Lower the heat to medium and add the prosciutto to the drippings in the pan, sauté for 1 minute to render out some of the fat. Now, add the mushrooms and sauté until they are nicely browned and their moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Pour the Marsala in the pan and boil down for a few seconds to cook out the alcohol. Add the chicken stock and simmer for a minute to reduce the sauce slightly. Stir in the butter and return the chicken to the pan; simmer gently for 1 minute to heat the chicken through. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with chopped parsley before serving.<br>

05/18/2014<br>
Ingredients:<br>
2 boned chicken thighs<br>
Pennsylvania Dutch Pot-Pie squares (12 oz)<br>
Good pinch of Saffron<br>
4 ribs celery sliced<br>
1/4 Tsp. celery seeds<br>
1/2 cut Onion chopped&nbsp;<br>
4 large potatoes quartered<br>
chicken broth/or water with chicken bouillon cube ratio<br>
1/4 Tsp. pepper<br>
1 chicken bouillon cube (IF using just water instead of broth)<br>
Place the 2 boned chicken thighs into the big yellow pot and fill with water/broth to cover the chicken thighs.<br>
Bring water/broth to full boil and then add the saffron, celery, celery seed, onions, pepper to pot and reduce heat to medium (low boil).<br>
Boil for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.<br>
Remove chicken thighs from pot and let cool on plate.  This chicken will be added back into the pot in the last moments, as I used to put in right away, but the chicken really separated into strings.. It didn't hurt the taste, but looked weird.<br>
Add quartered potatoes and maintain low boil for 10 minutes then add the Pot-Pie squares (about half the bag, as they will swell up and will sop up the broth) and mix well.  Low boil for another 15 minutes, stirring frequently.<br>
Remove chicken from bone and remove and discard the skin.  Cut into bite size pieces and add to pot... let heat up for 10 minutes or so and that's it.<br>

Recipe Name:CRISPY OVEN CHICKEN THIGHS<br>
06/29/2014<br>
Ingredients<br>
Chicken thighs<br>
Seasoning or seasoning of salt<br>
Instructions<br>
Preheat oven to 425°  convention. Pat dry the chicken thighs.<br>
Prep a baking sheet. Line with aluminum foil, add a rack and give a heavy spray of PAM.<br>
Place thighs skin down and sprinkle lightly with the spices of your choice. I went with 7:2:1 or 7:2:2. ( If you don't have that then about a tablespoon of coarse salt, 1 tsp. pepper and ½ to 1 tsp. of granulated garlic.This is more than you need. Keep for next time.) A pinch of cayenne would be good also. Flip and tuck in any thin parts underneath and sprinkle skin side.<br>
With skin side up, bake until internal temp of 180°  to 185° . About 30 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes or more prior to serving.<br>
Notes<br>
Smoking ovens have been an issue for some due to high temp cooking. I haven’t had the problem BUT it is probably related to multiple factors. First if there is trimmable fat, trim it. Use a pan with some side on it to keep any splatter contained. If your oven has convection roast and convection bake, use the bake mode. And lastly you could turn down the oven by 25-50 degrees. This will increase the cooking time some and may prone to drying out some. Remember to cook to an end point not by time. Of course the oven should be clean so the smoke isn’t coming from a previous splatter.<br>

Recipe Name:CUP CAKE OMELET<br>
08/18/2014<br>
Ingredients<br>
2 eggs<br>
4 teaspoons milk<br>
1/4 teaspoon oil<br>
1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br>
4 tablespoons shredded cheese<br>
4 tablespoons chopped ham or bacon or sausage or chicken or whatever<br>
4 tablespoons onions, diced<br>
4 tablespoons green pepper, diced<br>
Directions<br>
Fry up the onions, green pepper and the ham or bacon or sausage or chicken till onions are brown.<br>
Place into muffin pan. (4 wells of muffin pan.)<br>
Sprinkle all 4 tops with shredded cheese.<br>
Mix the 2 eggs together and add 4 tablespoons milk and  1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of oil.<br>
Pour egg mixture on top of all 4 muffin pan wells.<br>
Place in 375 degree oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown and puffed up.<br>
mike note--------<br>
Once I poured the egg mixture on top I mixed it up a bit so it was pretty consistent.  I also put a thin slice of butter on the top.<br>
This was VERY good!  I think making 1 big one might be good too.  The baking powder puffs it up and it almost taste and texture looks like there is flour in it.  Very light and there was a lot of flavor.<br>

Recipe Name:EGGS BENEDICT<br>
10/29/2014<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 egg yolks<br>
2-1/2 teaspoons lemon juice<br>
1/4 pinch ground white pepper<br>
1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
3/4 teaspoon water<br>
1/4 cup butter, melted<br>
1/8 teaspoon salt<br>
2 eggs<br>
1/4 teaspoon distilled white vinegar<br>
2 strips Canadian-style bacon<br>
1 English muffins, split<br>
1-1/2 teaspoons butter, softened<br>
To Make Hollandaise:<br>
Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolk, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.<br>
Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.<br>
Preheat oven on broiler setting.&nbsp;<br>
To Poach Eggs:<br>
Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate<br>
While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.<br>
Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.<br>

Recipe Name:Fried Chicken Easier&nbsp;<br>
10/30/2014<br>
We wanted fried chicken with a super-crisp crust and juicy meat without resorting to quarts of oil.&nbsp;<br>
Easier Fried Chicken<br>
Serves 4<br>
A whole 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces, can be used instead of the chicken parts. Skinless chicken&nbsp;<br>
pieces are also an acceptable substitute, but the meat will come out slightly drier. A Dutch oven with&nbsp;<br>
an 11-inch diameter can be used in place of the straight-sided sauté pan.<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 1/4 cups buttermilk<br>
Table salt<br>
Dash hot sauce<br>
3 teaspoons ground black pepper<br>
1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
1 teaspoon paprika<br>
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>
3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (breasts, thighs, and drumsticks, or a mix, with breasts cut in&nbsp;<br>
half), trimmed of excess fat<br>
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br>
2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
1 3/4 cups vegetable oil<br>
Instructions<br>
1. Whisk 1 cup buttermilk, 1 tablespoon salt, hot sauce, 1 teaspoon black pepper, ¼ teaspoon garlic<br>
powder, ¼ teaspoon paprika, and pinch of cayenne together in large bowl. Add chicken and turn to&nbsp;<br>
coat. Refrigerate, covered, at least 1 hour or up to overnight.<br>
2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk flour, baking powder, 1&nbsp;<br>
teaspoon salt, and remaining 2 teaspoons black pepper, ¾ teaspoon garlic powder, ¾ teaspoon&nbsp;<br>
paprika, and remaining cayenne together in large bowl. Add remaining ¼ cup buttermilk to flour&nbsp;<br>
mixture and mix with fingers until combined and small clumps form. Working with 1 piece at a time,&nbsp;<br>
dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture, pressing mixture onto pieces to form thick, even coating. Place<br>
dredged chicken on large plate, skin side up.<br>
3. Heat oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Carefully place&nbsp;<br>
chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and&nbsp;<br>
continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack<br>
set in rimmed baking sheet. Bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of&nbsp;<br>
chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces&nbsp;<br>
may cook faster than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let&nbsp;<br>
chicken rest 5 minutes before serving.<br>

Recipe Name:HOMEMADE CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS<br>
03/08/2015<br>
Homemade Chicken and Dumplings<br>
Ingredients<br>
about 3 cups cooked chicken<br>
6-8 cups chicken broth<br>
2 cups flour<br>
2 Tbs. butter<br>
1/2 tsp. baking powder<br>
salt to taste (I just shake some in)<br>
about a cup of milk, maybe a bit less<br>
Directions<br>
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.  Cut the butter into the dry ingredients&nbsp;<br>
with a fork or pastry blender.  Stir in the milk, mixing with a fork  until the dough forms a ball.<br>
Heavily flour a work surface.  You’ll need a rolling pin and something to cut the dumplings&nbsp;<br>
with.  I like to use a pizza cutter.  I also like to use a small spatula to lift the dumplings off the cutting surface.<br>
Roll the dough out thin with a heavily floured rolling pin.  Dip your cutter in flour and cut the dumplings in squares about 2?x2?.  It’s okay for them not to be exact.  Just eye ball it.  Some will be bigger, some smaller, some shaped funny.<br>
Use the floured spatula to put them on a heavily floured plate.  Just keep flouring between the layers of dumplings.  If they will be cooked soon, this method works well.  If I’m going to cook them later in the day I layer them on a cookie sheet with wax paper between and lots of flour.  You can also freeze them like this and then transfer them to a ziplock bag.<br>
To cook them, bring the broth to a boil.  Drop the dumplings in one at a time, stirring while you add them.  The extra flour on them will help thicken the broth.  Cook them for about 15-20 minutes or until they not doughy tasting.  Add the cooked chicken to the pot and you’re done!<br>

KFC Fried Chicken<br>
Prep Time: 15 minutes<br>
Cook Time: 10 minutes<br>
Total Time: 25 minutes<br>
Ingredients:<br>
1 teaspoon dried sage<br>
1 teaspoon dried basil<br>
1 teaspoon dried marjoram<br>
1 teaspoon pepper<br>
2 teaspoons salt<br>
2 Tablespoons paprika<br>
1 Tablespoon onion salt<br>
1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
2 Tablespoons Accent (MSG seasoning)<br>
1 can lard (or one 3-pound can Crisco), enough to cover chicken in fryer (see Secret Recipe Tips below)<br>
1 egg, beaten<br>
1 cup buttermilk<br>
One 3-pound chicken, cut into 6 pieces<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon ground oregano<br>
1 teaspoon chili powder<br>
Preparation:<br>
The author says: "What's the secret behind Colonel Sanders's famous eleven herbs and spices? a pressure fryer.<br>
Combine the egg and buttermilk in a large bowl. Soak the chicken pieces in the mixture.<br>
Add the flour to a separate bowl and fold in all the herbs and spices. Roll the chicken in the seasoned flour until completely covered.<br>
Add the lard to a pressure fryer and heat to 365 F. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's directions for your pressure fryer.<br>
Use a utensil to lower 4 pieces of the chicken into the hot oil, and lock the lid in place. Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot oil.<br>
Allow to fry for 8 to 10 minutes, until the chicken is golden brown and thoroughly cooked.<br>
Once the pieces are cooked, release the pressure according to the manufacturer's directions and remove the chicken to paper towels or a metal rack to drain.<br>
Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of chicken.<br>
Yield: 6 pieces<br>
Secret Recipe Tips: The real secret to making this is the Accent in the recipe and using a pressure fryer!<br>
Make sure the oil is at 365 F before frying the chicken. To avoid making a mess, use a utensil when adding the chicken. Quickly lock the lid on the pressure fryer once all the pieces of chicken have been added.<br>
For crispier chicken, use Crisco instead of lard and double-coat the chicken with the flour mixture.&nbsp;<br>

Hard boil 1 egg and dice it up.<br>
Brink Swanson chicken broth to a boil  Add 1 chicken bouillon cube and 1 cup of water.<br>
Keep a low boil.<br>
Cut chicken into 1/2" pieces and fry in olive oil, not till brown, but until just cooked.<br>

It really surprised me! it didn't start out looking too good, but started to smell really good and it turned out it was! It would of been much better if I had used fresh corn rather than a can of corn. There was actually too much chicken in it and there should of been more than 1 small can of corn it it. I did not add any salt or pepper to it while it was cooking.<br>

05/23/2015<br>
Ingredient quanties have been measured to fit the large clear glass oblong casserole disk.<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 Pillsbury pie crust (usually 2 rolled up) per box.<br>
2 chicken thighs.  About 2 cups.<br>
3 med potatoes, peeled and cubed.<br>
2 cup diced celery.<br>
2 cup carrots chopped up.<br>
2 cup peas.<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper.<br>
1/2 tablespoon parsley chopped up.<br>
1 chicken botulin cube.<br>
1/4 teaspoon saffron.<br>
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.<br>
1 1/2 tablespoon flour or corn starch.<br>
* a small diced up onion might be a good addition too??<br>
Boil the two chicken thighs in lightly salted water for 1 hour.  Fill with water as much as it<br>
will take.  I used the largest silver pot.&nbsp;<br>
After 1 hour of boiling remove both chicken thighs and place on a plate to cool.<br>
Dissolve the flour or the corn starch in small amount of water.  Slowly add mixture to the chicken broth and stir over med heat till thickened.<br>
Dissolve chicken bouillon and add to broth.<br>
Removed the chicken from bones and add to broth.<br>
Add the potatoes, celery, carrots, peas saffron, salt, pepper and garlic to the broth and cook under low heat about 15 minutes.<br>
You want the mixture to be pretty thick, not runny.<br>
Pour entire mixture in the round glass casserole disk, which has been coated with Crisco.<br>
Cover with one of the round Pillsbury pie crusts.<br>
Bake in 450° oven for 40 minutes.<br>
It was very good, but it didn't entirely fill the oblong glass casserole dish.  I've since increased the amount of  celery/carrots/peas to 2 cups each instead of 1 cup each).  And perhaps a McCormick's chicken gravy mix to it if it needs more fill.<br>

Heat about a quarter inch of oil in a skillet over high heat. When the oil is very hot (just before smoking), lay the chicken pieces in. When they are nicely browned on one side, two or three minutes (MORE LIKE 1 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE), flip them. When they are uniformly browned, drain the oil from the skillet (keeping the chicken pieces in the skillet), and put the skillet in the oven for up to 30 minutes.  (MINE WERE RED IN THE MIDDLE SO PUT BACK INTO OVEN AT 350 FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES).<br>

Recipe Name:PEPPERONI &amp; MOZZARELLA STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS<br>
11/21/2015<br>
7/1/2014 5<br>
Pepperoni &amp; Mozzarella Stuffed Chicken Breasts<br>
recipe from Sandi Endy<br>
Ingredients:<br>
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br>
2 oz. mozzarella cheese<br>
1.25 oz. (approx. 16 slices) pepperoni<br>
1 large egg<br>
1/2 cup all purpose flour<br>
1/2 cup bread crumbs<br>
6 Tbsps. vegetable oil<br>
to taste salt and pepper<br>
STEP 1: Trim the chicken breasts. Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces.&nbsp;<br>
Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in.<br>
STEP 2: Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.<br>
STEP 3: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp. of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and&nbsp;<br>
the bread crumbs in the third (Pampered Chef Coating Trays would be great for this). Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp. of water helps break it up).<br>
STEP 4: One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the&nbsp;<br>
egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.<br>
STEP 5: Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and you’ll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.<br>
STEP 6: When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven.<br>
Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces). Remove from the oven (check to make sure the chicken is cooked through) and serve immediately!<br>

Recipe Name:PERFECT PAN-FRIED CHICKEN THIGHS<br>
11/21/2015<br>
Yield: 4 servings<br>
1 tablespoon coconut oil or light flavored olive oil<br>
4-6 chicken thighs, depending on size (4 large pieces fill my skillet)<br>
kosher salt<br>
freshly ground black pepper<br>
Optional spices: garlic and paprika<br>
Pour the oil into a large stainless or cast-iron skillet over medium heat.  Generously sprinkle the skin side of the chicken thighs with spices and then place them in the hot skillet, skin side down. Sprinkle the other side of the thighs and then, without moving them, cook uncovered* for about 20-25 minutes. Let them cook until the fat has rendered and the skin is deep golden brown and crisp; this could take as long as 30 minutes.<br>
If the skin is sticking to the pan, it likely isn't finished on that side. Reduce the heat as needed if the skin starts to burn before it is evenly golden brown. Turn the thighs over and continue to cook for about 20 more minutes. When the meat closest to the bone is cooked through, the chicken is done. Enjoy!<br>

Recipe Name:Easy Shepherd's Pie<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br>
Cook time: 50 minutes<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 1/2 lbs ground round beef<br>
1 onion chopped<br>
1 to 2 cups vegetables - chopped carrots, corn, peas<br>
1 1/2 - 2 lbs potatoes (3 big ones)<br>
8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)<br>
1/2 cup beef broth<br>
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
Salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice<br>
Method<br>
1) Peel and quarter potatoes, boil in salted water until tender (about 20 minutes).<br>
2) While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 Tablespoons butter (1/2 a stick) in large frying pan.<br>
3) Sauté onions in butter until tender over medium heat (10 mins). If you are adding vegetables, add them according to cooking time. Put any carrots in with the onions. Add corn or peas either at the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat has initially cooked.<br>
4) Add ground beef and sauté until no longer pink.&nbsp;<br>
Add salt and pepper. Add Worcestershire sauce.&nbsp;<br>
Add half a cup of beef broth and cook, uncovered, over low heat for 10 minutes, adding more beef&nbsp;<br>
broth as necessary to keep moist.<br>
5 Mash potatoes in bowl with remainder of butter, season to taste.<br>
6 Place beef and onions in baking dish. Distribute mashed potatoes on top. Rough up with a fork so that there are peaks that will brown nicely. You can use the fork to make some designs in the&nbsp;<br>
potatoes as well.<br>
7 Cook in 400 degree oven until bubbling and brown (about 30 minutes). Broil for last few minutes&nbsp;<br>
if necessary to brown.<br>
Yield: Serves four.<br>
THIS RECIPE WAS VERY VERY GOOD!<br>
I tweaked this recipe a bit.  I just used like a 1/2 cup green beans and 1/2 cup peas and some<br>
carrots too.  Before I did step 5 I made a cup of McCormick beef gravy mix using a cup of beef&nbsp;<br>
broth rather than water.  I added the gravy mix to the mix.  I put all of the mix into the brown glass<br>
baking dish (13 x 13 ?).  When I added the potatoes I really could of used a lot more.  More like&nbsp;<br>
4 or 5 potatoes could of been  used.  Also, it was a bit loose/wet, might have been well to add some corn starch or flour to the mix to thicken it up a bit.<br>

1 lb. ground beef.<br>
1 cup chopped onions.<br>
2  tablespoons flour.<br>
3/4  teaspoon salt.<br>
1/4  teaspoon  pepper.<br>
1 beef bouillon cube dissolved in 1  cup water.<br>
1 can (small) mushrooms.<br>
3  tablespoons sour cream or Phil cream cheese (cream cheese is better).<br>
Directions<br>

Gradually still in bouillon and mushrooms and stir over medium heat until mixture thickens and boils.<br>
Stir in sour cream/phil cream cheese and cook 5 minutes (do not boil).<br>
Serve over noodles or rice.<br>
It could of used more bouillon juice, as it was not very fluidly.  I added water and then some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Mom used to put ginger in it, but I didn't particularly like the ginger in it.<br>
I want to try on Chinese noodles!  (I TRIED THE CHINESE NOODLES AND IT WAS NOT THAT GREAT) and I tried left overs with Jalapenos and it a nice addition!<br>
You can also add celery and green pepper when adding the onions.<br>
Mom thought this was very good and the first time I made it I thought it was fair and I remembered that Mom used to put ginger in it.  When I reheated the leftover, on the next day... it was VERY GOOD!  Overnighting things can sure improve them.<br>
Place over rice or noodles<br>

Recipe Name:MEATLOAF MEATBALLS WITH HORSERADISH MASH AND GRAVY<br>
03/14/2013<br>
Ingredients For the meatballs:<br>
Serves 6<br>
3 tablespoons butter<br>
1 onion, finely chopped<br>
2 small ribs celery, finely chopped<br>
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
2 tablespoons thyme, finely chopped<br>
1/4 cup dry sherry or white wine<br>
3 1-inch-thick slices good-quality white bread, crusts trimmed<br>
About 1 cup whole milk<br>
2 pounds ground sirloin<br>
1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped<br>
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce<br>
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br>
1 large egg plus 1 yolk, lightly beaten<br>
Olive oil cooking spray<br>
For the horseradish mash:<br>
2 1/2-3 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and chunked<br>
Salt<br>
1 cup sour cream<br>
1/4-1/2 cup half-and-half or heavy cream<br>
Coarse black pepper<br>
3-4 tablespoons horseradish, to taste<br>
1/4-1/3 cup chives, chopped<br>
For the gravy:<br>
4 tablespoons butter<br>
3 tablespoons flour<br>
3 cups beef stock<br>
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce<br>
Coarse black pepper<br>
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten<br>
Preparation<br>
For the meatballs, pre-heat the oven to 400ºF.<br>
Heat a sauté pan over medium to medium-high heat; melt the butter. Add the onion, celery and garlic; season with salt, pepper and thyme. Cook to tender, 7-8 minutes. Deglaze with sherry or wine, let cool.<br>
Soak the bread in the milk while the veggies cool.<br>
Place the meat in a mixing bowl; season with salt and pepper. Squeeze the liquid out of the bread and crumble the bread into the bowl. Add the cooked vegetables, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and eggs, combine to mix but do not overwork.<br>
Place a piece of parchment on a baking sheet and roll the meat into 18 balls. Spray them with cooking spray and roast for about 15-18 minutes, until lightly crispy and golden and cooked through.<br>
Cool and store for a make-ahead meal. Reheat, covered, in a pre-heated 375ºF oven with a splash of water in the bottom of the dish. Once the meatballs are hot, uncover and let them crisp up for 5 minutes.<br>
For the mash, fill a pot half-way with cold water; peel and add the potatoes as they are chopped or, if you peeled up the potatoes ahead, place in a pot and fill with fresh water. (You can make the potatoes the night you serve or peel up the potatoes ahead of time and store them in the fridge covered in water.) Add enough water to cover the potatoes, then cover the pot and place over high heat to bring&nbsp;<br>
to a boil. Once the water boils, remove the lid, salt the water and cook uncovered at a low boil until fork-tender. Drain and return to the hot pot. Mash the potatoes with the sour cream and cream, a liberal dose of pepper, horseradish and the chives; salt to your taste. If you wish to make the potatoes ahead of time and hold them for a couple of hours, place an inch of water in a large pot and bring to boil. Reduce the heat to low and place a smaller pot filled with the potatoes into the simmering water and cover that pot.<br>
For the gravy, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour, bring to a bubble, then whisk in the stock and Worcestershire sauce, season with black pepper and thicken. Temper the egg yolk by lightly beating a ladle of gravy into it, then whisk it into the sauce. Cool and store; reheat over medium heat, adding a little more stock if necessary to loosen.<br>
In shallow bowls, spoon in enough potatoes to gently mound up, then arrange a few meatballs in the center of the mound. Ladle gravy down over top and garnish with parsley.<br>

04/20/2013<br>
Serves 6 to 8<br>
If you’re short the 2 tablespoons of meatloaf drippings needed to make the gravy, supplement them with melted butter or vegetable oil.<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 cup water<br>
1/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed<br>
16 square or 18 round saltines<br>
10 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed<br>
1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
1 onion, chopped fine<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
4 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 pound ground pork<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
1 pound 85 percent lean ground beef<br>
3/4 teaspoon minced fresh thyme<br>
1/4 cup all-purpose flour<br>
2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br>
Instructions<br>
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Microwave water and porcini mushrooms in covered bowl until steaming, about 1 minute. Let sit until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove porcini from bowl with fork and mince. Strain porcini liquid through fine-mesh strainer lined with coffee filter; reserve ¾ cup.<br>
2. Process saltines in food processor until finely ground, about 30 seconds; transfer to large bowl. Pulse half of white mushrooms in processor until finely ground, 8 to 10 pulses.<br>
3. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick oven safe skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add processed white mushrooms and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook until liquid evaporates and mushrooms begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl with saltines and let cool completely, about 15 minutes.<br>
4. Add pork, eggs, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire, 1 teaspoon salt, ¾ teaspoon pepper, and ¼ cup reserved porcini liquid to cooled white mushroom– saltine mixture and knead gently until mostly combined. Add beef and knead until well combined. Transfer meat mixture to now-empty skillet and shape into 10 by 6-inch loaf. Bake until meatloaf registers 160 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes. Transfer meatloaf to carving board using spatula and tent loosely with aluminum foil.<br>
5. Thinly slice remaining white mushrooms. Discard any solids in skillet and pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Heat fat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add sliced white mushrooms and minced porcini mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in thyme and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring frequently, until golden, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in broth, remaining ½ cup reserved porcini liquid, and remaining ¾ teaspoon Worcestershire, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Slice meatloaf and serve with mushroom gravy.<br>

3/4 cup water<br>
1 small can mushrooms<br>
1 can kidney beans<br>
* I used DELMONT'S DICED TOMATO BASIL GARLIC &amp; OREGANO (no salt).<br>
In my opinion the DELMONTE diced tomato basic garlic oregano makes the chili!!<br>

Recipe Name:Roast beef<br>
07/13/2014<br>
Cook time: 3 hours<br>
Ingredients<br>
3 to 3 1/2 lbs (1.3 to 1.6 kg) of Boneless Rump Roast (pick an end cut with a layer of fat if you can)<br>
Olive oil<br>
8 slivers of garlic<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
Meat thermometer<br>
For the gravy:<br>
Red wine, water, and or beef stock<br>
corn starch<br>
Method<br>
1 Start with the roast at room temperature (remove from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking - keep it wrapped). Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>
2 With a sharp knife make 8 small incisions around the roast. Place a sliver of garlic into each incision. Take a tablespoon or so of olive oil and spread all around the roast. Sprinkle around the roast with salt and pepper. Place the roast directly on an oven rack, fatty side up, with a drip pan on a rack beneath the roasting rack. This arrangement creates convection in the oven so that you do not need to turn the roast. The roast is placed fat side up so that as the fat melts it will bathe the entire roast in its juices.<br>
3 Brown the roast at 375°F (190°C) for half an hour. Lower the heat to 225°F (107°C). The roast should take somewhere from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours additionally to cook. The shape of the roast will affect the cooking time, by the way. So if your roast is on the long and narrow side, versus a more round shape, it may take less time to cook. So keep an eye on it. When the roast just starts to drip its juices and it is brown on the outside, check the temperature with a meat thermometer. Pull the roast from the oven when the inside temperature of the roast is 135° to 140°F (57°C to 60°C). Let the roast rest for at least 15 minutes, tented in aluminum foil to keep warm, before carving to serve.<br>
To make the gravy:<br>
Remove the dripping pan from the oven and place on the stove top at medium heat. Note that if you are pulling the roast out early, for rare or a medium rare level of doneness, you may not have a lot of drippings. Hopefully you will have some. If not, you may want to leave the roast in a little longer at even lower heat, 175°F, to ease some more drippings out of it. Add some water, red wine, or beef stock to the drippings to deglaze (loosen the drippings from the pan). Dissolve a tablespoon of cornstarch in a little water and add to the drip pan. Stir quickly while the gravy thickens to avoid lumping. You can add a little butter if there is not a lot of fat in the drippings. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mom adds some fresh thyme too if she has some. (See also How to Make Gravy.)<br>
Yield: Serves 4-6.<br>

reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.<br>
after 30 minutes, out of the over, the temperature of the roast should be 115 to 140 degrees.<br>
Put roast back into the 325 degree oven and bake for 30 minutes. Till its temperature is 145 degrees.<br>
Possibly COULD OF left it in longer than 30 minutes?  The port squeaked when I cut it, so maybe it&nbsp;<br>
should of been in longer?  It didn't exactly fall apart.  It was very moist and the top crust was cursty, but&nbsp;<br>
I felt it could of been more crusty.<br>

Stuffed Pig's Stomach (Hog Maw)<br>
Serves 6 to 8<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 large pig's stomach, well cleaned of all fat<br>
1 pound fresh link sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices<br>
1 pound smoked linked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch slices<br>
6-8 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br>
2 medium onions, coarsely chopped<br>
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped<br>
Salt and pepper to taste (go easy on salt depending on sausage)<br>
3 tablespoons flour, mixed with 3 tablespoons cool water until smooth to make a slurry (to thicken the gravy)<br>
Preheat oven to 350° F. Mix together sausages, potatoes and onions. Add parsley, salt and pepper. Sew the small opened end of the stomach with cooking twine to close. Stuff sausage mixture into stomach, pressing well with each addition. The stomach has a lot of elasticity and will stretch to almost any size necessary. When all stuffing has been placed inside, close open end with twine.<br>
Place stuffed stomach in a shallow roasting pan. Roast until potatoes are tender (check by inserting a thin sharp knife into middle of stomach), about 2 hours, basting about every 20 minutes with water or pan juices.<br>

Pork Cutlets: An Old Southern Favorite<br>
Prep Time: 10 minutes<br>
Cook Time: 10 minutes<br>
Total Time: 20 minutes<br>
Ingredients:<br>
2 4-oz. boneless pork loin chops; trimmed of fat<br>
Rubbed sage, paprika, salt, black pepper<br>
1/4 cup all purpose flour<br>
1 egg; beaten in pie plate<br>
1/4 cup bread crumbs<br>
2 Tbsp. olive oil<br>
1/2 lemon; cut in half<br>
Preparation:<br>
1. Pound chop to about 1/4" thick and season generously with sage, paprika, salt, and pepper.*<br>
2. Add oil to a non-stick skillet and heat over medium high heat until oil shimmers.<br>
3. Dredge the chops in the flour, coat with egg, and thoroughly coat with bread crumbs.** Set chop aside.<br>
4. Fry chop on each side until golden and crisp (about 2 minutes per side). Serve immediately with a lemon wedge.&nbsp;<br>
* seasoning the pork directly is much more effective than seasoning the flour and or seasoning the bread crumbs alone.&nbsp;<br>
** Flour will adhere to the meat. The egg will adhere to the flour. And the bread crumbs will adhere to the egg.<br>

Recipe Name:Pork roast and sauerkraut - crock pot<br>
07/07/2013<br>
Preparing the Roast, a roast between three and five pounds in size for these instructions.  Obviously cook longer if bigger than 5 Lbs.<br>
You can sear the roast on each side before placing it in the cooker.&nbsp;<br>
Sprinkle pork roast with salt and pepper cayenne pepper and garlic. Melt butter in 5-quart ovenproof saucepan or Dutch oven until sizzling; add pork roast. Cook over medium heat, turning several times, until browned (7 to 9 minutes).&nbsp;<br>
This will add more flavors to the meat, but it is not a necessary step. Sprinkle the bottom side of the pork roast with seasonings such as pepper, salt, cayenne pepper and garlic. Place the roast into the slow cooker and add seasonings to the top portion of the meat.  Place 2 (27 oz.) cans of sauerkraut around the outside of the roast as well as 2 27 oz. cans of water (or less).<br>
Turn the slow cooker on high and allow the pork roast to cook at this temperature for one hour. Turn the cooker down to low after the hour and let the pork roast continue cooking. Try not to open the slow cooker's lid during the cooking process, or you will lose heat. It's estimated that every time the lid is opened, twenty minutes of heat is lost.&nbsp;<br>
The pork roast should be done in approximately eight hours.<br>
The roast I recently bought was 5.6 Lbs, so I should cook for about 8 1/2 to 9 hours.<br>

3 tablespoons butter<br>
1 tbsp. minced garlic<br>
1 pkg (14 oz.) Crab Classic, Chunk Style (Trans-Ocean Products)<br>
1/2 tsp. salt<br>
1/4 tsp. pepper<br>
1/4 cup lemon juice<br>
1 cup milk<br>
Parmesan cheese, optional<br>
--- my additions that made this WAY good!<br>
1/2 teaspoon Fennel seeds<br>
1/2 teaspoon Old Bay<br>
1/4 teaspoon Allspice<br>
1/4 teaspoon Thyme<br>
1/4 teaspoon Oregano<br>
lemon zest<br>
---<br>
DIRECTIONS<br>
Cook linguine according to package directions; add asparagus during the last 2 minutes of cooking.<br>
Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of flour. Stir in the cup of milk into the mixture and heat, stirring constantly, with a spatula, until thick.  In other words 'make a rue'.  Then stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute or until fragrant. Add linguine and asparagus along with Crab Classic, salt and pepper, Fennel seeds, Allspice, Thyme, Old Bay and Oregano... Cook, stirring occasionally, until crab and asparagus are heated through (1-2 minutes). Stir in lemon juice.&nbsp;<br>
bake it for 30 minutes at 350°&nbsp;<br>
Serve with Parmesan cheese, if desired.&nbsp;<br>
This was very good!  The 1/4 cup of lemon juice is what makes it!  I didn't have asparagus so I used green beans, but I'm sure it was just as good asparagus would of been.<br>

Recipe Name:SCALLOPS PAN-SEARED<br>
02/06/2015<br>
We strongly recommend purchasing “dry” scallops (those without chemical additives). If you can only find “wet” scallops, soak them in a solution of 1 quart cold water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons table salt for 30 minutes before proceeding with step 1. In step 2, season the scallops with pepper only. If you are unsure whether your scallops are wet or dry, conduct this quick test: Place 1 scallop on a paper towel-lined, microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power for 15 seconds. If the scallop is “dry,” it will exude very little water. If it is “wet,” there will be a sizable ring of moisture on the paper towel. (The microwaved scallop can be cooked as is.) Prepare the sauce (if serving) while the scallops dry (between steps 1 and 2) and keep it warm while cooking them. For an accompaniment, use one of our recipes for Orange-Lime Vinaigrette, Ginger Butter Sauce, and Caper-Mustard Sauce.<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 1/2 pounds dry sea scallop, 10 to 20 per pound, tendons removed<br>
Salt and pepper (DON'T ADD SALT HERE) scallops are very salty<br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>
Lemon wedges<br>
Instructions<br>
1. Place scallops on rimmed baking sheet lined with clean dish towel. Place second clean dish towel on top of scallops and press gently on towel to blot liquid. Let scallops sit at room temperature for 10 minutes while towels absorb moisture.<br>
2. Sprinkle scallops on both sides with salt (DON'T ADD SALT HERE) scallops are very salty<br>
and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add half of scallops in single layer, flat side down, and cook, without moving them, until well browned, about 2 minutes.<br>
3. Add 1 tablespoon butter to skillet. Using tongs, flip scallops; continue to cook, using large spoon to baste scallops with melted butter (tilt skillet so butter runs to 1 side) until sides of scallops are firm and centers are opaque and register 115 degrees, 30 to 90 seconds longer (remove smaller scallops as they finish cooking). Transfer scallops to large plate and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Wipe out skillet with paper towels and repeat with remaining oil, scallops, and butter. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.<br>
Technique<br>
Going For a Soak<br>
So-called wet scallops have been treated with sodium tripolyphosphate (STP), which lends a disagreeable flavor. Could we get rid of the STP by soaking the scallops in water?<br>
THE EXPERIMENT<br>
We prepared three batches of “wet” scallops, soaking the first in a quart of water for 30 minutes, soaking the second for an hour, and leaving the third untreated. We then cooked each batch according to our recipe and sent them to a lab to be analyzed for STP content.<br>
THE RESULTS<br>
The scallops soaked for 30 minutes only had about 10 percent less STP than the untreated batch, and soaking for a full hour wasn’t much better: Only about 11 percent of the STP was removed. Tasters were still able to clearly identify an unpleasant chemical flavor in both soaked samples.<br>
THE EXPLANATION<br>
The phosphates in STP form a chemical bond with the proteins in scallops. The bonds are so strong that they prevent the STP from being washed away, no matter how long the scallops are soaked.<br>
THE SOLUTION<br>
Rather than try to remove the chemical taste from STP-treated scallops, we masked it by soaking them in a solution of lemon juice, water, and salt.<br>
CHEMICAL COVERUP<br>
A lemon-flavored brine camouflages the off-taste of "wet" scallops.<br>

Ingredients<br>
1 to 1 1/4 pounds dry sea scallops, approximately 16<br>
2 teaspoons unsalted butter<br>
2 teaspoons olive oil<br>
Kosher salt (DON'T ADD SALT HERE) scallops are very salty<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
Directions<br>
Remove the small side muscle from the scallops, rinse with cold water and thoroughly pat dry.<br>
Add the butter and oil to a 12 to 14-inch sauté pan on high heat. Salt (DON'T ADD SALT HERE) scallops are very salty and pepper the scallops. Once the fat begins to smoke, gently add the scallops, making sure they are not touching each other. Sear the scallops for 2 minutes on each side. The scallops should have a 1/4-inch golden crust on each side while still being translucent in the center. Serve immediately.<br>

Recipe Name:CORN PIE (MOMS)<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Per Randy<br>
Ingredients<br>
6 ears of corn<br>
2 hard boiled eggs<br>
salt and pepper<br>
2  teaspoon  chopped fresh parsley<br>
milk (consider heavy cream, instead of milk.  Found in another recipe)<br>
consider:1/4 cup onion, minced (found in another recipe)<br>
pie dough*<br>
Directions<br>
Alternate corn and eggs and salt and pepper in layers.<br>
Milk to fill container 1/2 full.<br>
Put top pie crust on top.<br>
Bake 15 minutes at 425 degrees.<br>
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake for another 45 minutes.<br>
Stick to the times above, as I took out a bit early and it could of been baked a bit more.<br>
*I bought the small cheap box of pie crust and added some Crisco to it.. like 3 or 4 tsps, which gave it that Crisco taste I like.<br>
I brushed on beaten egg yoke on top of crust which DID make the top nice and brown.<br>
as of 10/10/14 instead of making a pie crust (either on my own or the cheap box of pie crust) I bought Giant brand pre-make pie crust (with the refrigerated cookie mix).  It had 2 rolled up round pie crusts and using them was easy enough to cover the glass casserole dish and it was very good tasting!<br>

Recipe Name:CORN PIE PA DUTCH&nbsp;<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Serves 6 to 8<br>
For the crust<br>
-------------------<br>
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
3 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled<br>
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled<br>
4–6 tablespoons ice water<br>
For the filling<br>
-------------------<br>
4 large eggs<br>
12 ears corn, husks and silk removed<br>
1 cup heavy cream<br>
4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>
1 onion, minced<br>
1 celery rib, chopped fine<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 garlic clove, minced<br>
1/4 teaspoon pepper<br>
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley<br>
Directions<br>
Make the crust<br>
1. Process the flour and salt together in a food processor until combined. Scatter the shortening over the top and process until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 10 seconds. Scatter the butter pieces over the top and pulse the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 pulses. Transfer the mixture to a bowl.<br>
2. Sprinkle 4 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture. Stir and press the dough together, using a stiff rubber spatula, until the dough sticks together. If the dough does not come together, stir in the remaining water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it does.<br>
3. Turn the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into a 4-inch disk. Wrap the dough tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 2 days. Before rolling out the dough, let it sit on the counter to soften slightly, about 10 minutes.<br>
Make the corn filling<br>
4. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>
5. Hard-boil 2 of the eggs by covering them with 1 quart water in a small saucepan and bringing to a boil over high heat. As soon as the water reaches a boil, remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare a bowl of ice water. Transfer the eggs to the ice water and cool for 5 minutes. Peel the eggs, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices, and set aside.<br>
6. Meanwhile, slice the corn kernels from the cobs. Process half of the corn (about 4 cups kernels) in a blender (or food processor) with the cream until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining 2 eggs and blend until combined, about 5 seconds. Set aside.<br>
7. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Off the heat, stir in the remaining corn kernels, corn-cream mixture, and parsley. Smooth the surface of the filling, then arrange the sliced eggs over the top in an even layer. Using your hands, break up the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into small pieces and scatter evenly over the top.<br>
8. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured counter to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut three oval-shaped vents, each about 1 inch long and 1/2 inch wide, in the center of the dough. Working quickly, roll the dough loosely over the rolling pin and unroll it evenly over the skillet. Trim the dough, leaving 1/2 inch hanging over the pan lip. Press the dough firmly to seal it to the lip of the pan. (For a decorative border, press the edges of the pie with the tines of a fork.)<br>
9. Place the skillet on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes before serving the pie.<br>

Recipe Name:Easy Corn Fritters<br>
11/01/2009<br>
15 oz. can corn (drain and reserve juice)<br>
2 medium eggs<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1 teaspoon sugar<br>
Bacon grease or margarine for frying<br>
Drain the liquid from the the canned corn. Measure 1/4 cup of it, and discard the rest. In a medium sized<br>
bowl combine the corn juice you’ve just measured and the eggs. Use a whisk to beat them smooth. Add<br>
the salt, flour, baking powder and sugar. Mix really well, until there are no lumps. Add the drained corn<br>
and mix again. Heat about 2 tablespoons of bacon grease or margarine in a large iron skillet over&nbsp;<br>
medium high heat. When the fat is hot, it’s time to drop in the fritters. I drop about 1/4 of a cup of batter for<br>
each fritter, cooking about 3 or 4 together in the same pan. Fry them just like pancakes, turning them,<br>
after the under side is crispy brown. They cook a little slower than pancakes, because they are thicker.<br>
After they have browned on both sides, transfer them to a plate to keep warm. Add more fat to the pan as<br>
necessary. This recipe makes about 8 or 9 fritters. I usually double it because they are so popular.<br>

1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese<br>
2 tablespoons flour&nbsp;<br>

this recipe was good, but could of used more cheese.  I used Sargentos (or something like that) cheese assortment and it was good with that.  I added some of the chesse to the top also, which made SOME of the top look like what scalloped potato top should look like once done.  Possibly more butter also.<br>

Fully Loaded Baked Potato Soup<br>
Guy Fieri<br>
Total Time:<br>
1 hr 15 min<br>
Prep 20 min&nbsp;<br>
Cook 55 min&nbsp;<br>
Yield:<br>
4 servings&nbsp;<br>
Ingredients<br>
4 large baking potatoes (Idaho or russet)<br>
12 slices thick-cut applewood smoked bacon<br>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>
6 cups 2 percent low-fat milk, heated<br>
5 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated<br>
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
4 ounces sour cream<br>
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives<br>
Directions<br>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br>
Place the potatoes on a roasting tray and bake for 45 minutes. When done, the tip of a paring knife should go through the potatoes easily.<br>
Slice the bacon into lardons (thin strips) and cook in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pot with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the drippings in the pot.<br>
Add the flour to the drippings in the pot and stir to combine. Cook, without adding color, until the flour and fat has combined, about 1 minute. Pour in the milk while you whisk to incorporate. Cook over medium heat until bubbly and thickened, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.<br>
Scoop out the potato pulp from the skins and add to the milk mixture. Mash with the back of a wooden spoon leaving it a little bit chunky.<br>
Add the cooked bacon (leaving a little out for garnishing the soup), 1 cup of the cheese, and season well with salt and pepper. Stir until the cheese has melted. Remove from the heat.<br>
Ladle the soup into bowls, drizzle with sour cream (from a squeeze bottle), sprinkle with remaining bacon bits, grated cheese and chives.<br>

Recipe Name:Green Beans and Potatoes<br>
11/01/2009<br>
This is just cooking times<br>
Green beans need to be in boiling water for 30 minutes.<br>
Potatoes need to be in boiling water for 20 minutes.<br>
in other words boil green beans for 10 minutes and then add the potatoes and continue boiling&nbsp;<br>
both together for another 20 minutes.<br>
Also, I used the big yellow pot to make the beans and potatoes in.  I filled it close to half way with<br>
water. I added the ham near the end of boiling, but now belived it should boil by itself, for 10 or&nbsp;<br>
15 minutes to get the ham flavor out of it.<br>
Also, I bought a ham hock at Roots and per internet this is how it should be cooked.....<br>
Place the ham hocks in the stockpot and cover them with 8 cups of water. To draw out the most flavor from&nbsp;<br>
the ham hocks, the water should be cool. As the water warms up it will slowly cook the ham hocks,&nbsp;<br>
releasing the flavor.<br>
Step 2<br>
Heat the stockpot over high heat. When the water begins to boil, cover the pot and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook the ham hocks for 2 hours. When they are finished, the ham hocks should be tender to the point of the meat falling off the bones.<br>

Total Time:50 min<br>
Ingredients<br>
2 red onions<br>
1 yellow onion<br>
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br>
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard<br>
1 teaspoon minced garlic<br>
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves<br>
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>
1/4 cup good olive oil<br>
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves<br>
Directions<br>
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.<br>
Remove the stem end of each onion and carefully slice off the brown part of the root end, leaving the root intact. Peel the onion. Stand each onion root end up on a cutting board and cut the onion in wedges through the root. Place the wedges in a bowl.<br>
For the dressing, combine the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Pour the dressing over the onions and toss well.<br>
With a slotted spoon, transfer the onions to a sheet pan, reserving the vinaigrette that remains in the bowl. Bake the onions for 30 to 45 minutes, until tender and browned. Toss the onions once during cooking. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with the reserved dressing. Sprinkle with parsley, season to taste and serve warm or at room temperature.<br>

1 onions chopped<br>
1 qt. milk&nbsp;<br>
2 tsp. salt<br>
1/4 tsp. pepper&nbsp;<br>
1 tbsp. butter<br>
1/2 cup flour&nbsp;<br>
1 egg, well beaten<br>
2-4 tbsp. milk&nbsp;<br>
2 tbsp. dried parsley<br>
Cook potatoes and onion in boiling salted water until tender. Drain.<br>
Add 1 qt milk to potatoes and heat. Blend in salt, pepper and parsley.<br>
Cut butter into flour, blend in the egg and milk using only enough milk<br>
to make mixture thin enough to drop into the hot soup. Drop by tea&nbsp;<br>
spoonful's into hot soup, cover and cook about 10 minutes. Serve at once.<br>
Makes 6-8 servings.<br>
Mikes comments:<br>
I added 2 hard boiled eggs to it and saffron.<br>
Less salt! only need 1 tsp.<br>
2 tbsp. of parsley seemed like overkill, 1 would of been plenty.<br>
I could of cooked for longer than 10 minutes once I put the flour/butter/milk mixture in.<br>
And within 10 minutes the lid started to come off as the flour/butter/milk mixture started<br>
to expand the lip off.  So use less or bigger kettle.  The flour/butter/milk mixture's taste<br>
was not very flavorful, maybe because I should of cook it longer? or it just needs some kind<br>
of spices in it?  I don't know what thought.<br>
Mikes comments:this was fair, I give it a 3.<br>

pepperonis<br>
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.&nbsp;<br>
Slice 1 potato thin<br>

Bake for an hour and a half<br>
the top became like the top of moms scallops potatoes! a brown crush type of deal * the crush was getting very dark towards the end, so I should of covered the top with more milk... probably should of been a good inch covering it.  It was very good,<br>
but I'd guess very fatty what with the grease that formed on it from the pepperoni.<br>

Recipe Name:Scalloped Potatoes<br>
08/14/2015<br>
3 Tbsp. butter<br>
2 lbs (about 4 medium sized) Russet potatoes, peeled, sliced 1/8" thick<br>
1 large yellow or white onion, thinly sliced<br>
2 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley<br>
1 Tbsp. chopped fresh chives<br>
2 thick slices of bacon, cooked and chopped<br>
2 1/2 cups grated Swiss or Gryere cheese (about 8 ounces)<br>
1/2/ cup grated Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)<br>
2 1/2 cups to 3 cups of half-and-half<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
1 tablespoon flour<br>
Preheat over to 350 degrees.&nbsp;<br>
Butter a large casserole dish with 1 1/2 Tbsp. of butter. If you use a casserole dish that is about 9x13 you'll have more&nbsp;<br>
surface area, more of the potatoes will brown and the cooking time will be faster.<br>
Layer the bottom of the casserole dish with 1/3 of the potato slices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Layer on 1/2 of the&nbsp;<br>
sliced onions and 1/2 cup of the Swiss cheese.<br>
Layer on 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the parsley and chives. Sprinkle with a little Parmesan.<br>
Repeat by layering on 1/3 of the potato slices, sprinkle again with salt and pepper, layer n the remaining sliced onions,&nbsp;<br>
1/2 cup of the Swiss cheese, the remaining bacon, parsley and chives,. Sprinkle with a little parmesan.<br>
Top the casserole with the remaining potato slices. Add the half and half.&nbsp;<br>
Dot the potatoes with the remaining 1/1/2 Tbsp. of butter.<br>
Sprinkle flour over the surface, stir gently then pour into a greased 2-quart casserole so top will brown up.<br>
Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake in oven for one hour.<br>
After and hour, remove from the over and remove the foil, sprinkle on the remaining Swiss and parmesan cheese.<br>
Return to the over and additional 30-40 minutes.<br>
When done, the potatoes should be tender, but not mushy and the liquid should be mostly absorbed.<br>
Serves 8.<br>
For a faster cooking time, you can parboil the sliced potatoes for 8 minutes first, patting them dry, before laying them&nbsp;<br>
in the casseroles pan. In this case the total oven cooking time is about 35-45 minutes<br>

Recipe Name:Scalloped Potatoes II<br>
08/31/2015<br>
good recipe!<br>
8 medium potatoes<br>
1 medium onion, diced<br>
8 slices bacon (or ham) diced<br>
1/2 cup flour<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
1/4 tsp. pepper<br>
1 cup milk<br>
Wash and peel potatoes. Cut into thin slices. In a greased casserole dish layer potatoes, onion, bacon/ham, flour, butter, salt and pepper . Repeat layers. Make sure there is a 2" space between top layer and top of casserole dish. Pour enough milk over potatoes to *almost cover potatoes. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until done. Stir once while baking.&nbsp;<br>
NOTE:to prevent casserole from cooking over, always use raw bacon and an uncovered dish. Fat from the bacon keeps the milk from boiling over.<br>
Mike Note:I baked at 400 degrees for an hour and it needed to be done longer. Suggest next time 400 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.  Also, they say to pour enough milk to *almost cover potatoes, but DO add enough milk to cover potatoes and maybe more, as I didn't get the browned top layer mom's used to get and I think the extra milk should do it.  Flour should also be added on top as well.<br>

Recipe Name:TOMATO PIE<br>
10/20/2015<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 9-inch pie shell (see pie crust recipe for homemade version)<br>
1/2 cup chopped yellow or red onion<br>
3-4 tomatoes, cut in half horizontally, squeezed to remove excess juice, roughly chopped, to yield approximately 3 cups chopped tomatoes<br>
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
1/4 cup sliced basil (about 8 large leaves)*<br>
2 cups grated cheese (combination of sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack, or Gruyere or Mozzarella)<br>
1/2 cup mayonnaise<br>
1 teaspoon (or more to taste) of Frank's Hot Sauce (or Tabasco)<br>
Freshly ground black pepper<br>
*To slice basil, chiffonade them by stacking the leaves on top of each other, roll them up like a cigar, starting at one end slice the "cigar" crosswise in thin slices.<br>
Method<br>
1 Preheat your oven to 350°F. Pre-bake the pie shell in the oven for about 8 to 10 minutes (a little longer for a frozen pie shell), until lightly browned.<br>
If you are using a homemade crust, freeze the crust first, then press a sheet of aluminum foil into the crust to keep the sides of the pie crust from falling down as it cooks. It helps to add some pie weights to hold the foil in place (I use several cups of dry pinto beans for this purpose). Pre-bake it for 15 minutes, then remove the foil, use the tines of a fork to poke a few small holes in the bottom of the crust (for venting), and bake for 10 more minutes.<br>
2 Lightly salt the chopped tomatoes and set them in a colander over a bowl to drain while you are pre-baking the crust. Squeeze as much moisture as you can out of the chopped tomatoes, using either paper towels, a clean dish towel, or a potato ricer.<br>
3 Sprinkle a layer of chopped onion over the bottom of your pre-baked pie crust shell. Spread the drained chopped tomatoes over the onions. Sprinkle the sliced basil over the tomatoes.<br>
tomato-pie-method-2 tomato-pie-method-3<br>
=================================<br>
4 In a medium bowl, mix together the grated cheese, mayonnaise, Tabasco, a sprinkling of  freshly ground black pepper. The mixture should be the consistency of a gooey snow ball. Spread the cheese mixture over the tomatoes.<br>
5 Place in oven and bake until browned and bubbly, anywhere from 25 to 45 minutes.<br>

Heat oven to 175 degrees. Test griddle by sprinkling a few drops of water on it. If water bounces and spatters off griddle, it is hot enough. Using a pastry brush, brush remaining 1/2 teaspoon of butter or reserved bacon fat onto griddle. Wipe off excess.<br>
Step 3<br>
Using a 4-ounce ladle, about 1/2 cup, pour pancake batter, in pools 2 inches away from one other. Scatter with berries, if using. When pancakes have bubbles on top and are slightly dry around edges, about 2 1/2 minutes, flip over. Cook until golden on bottom, about 1 minute.<br>
Step 4<br>
Repeat with remaining batter, keeping finished pancakes on a heatproof plate in oven. Serve warm.<br>

Recipe Name:CARROT CAKE<br>
11/01/2009<br>
for two<br>
Yields 1 6" cake.<br>
Ingredients<br>
FOR THE CAKE:<br>
¼ cup canola oil<br>
½ cup sugar<br>
1 large egg<br>
½ teaspoon cinnamon<br>
½ teaspoon vanilla<br>
¼ cup packed grated carrot (from 1 small carrot)<br>
½ cup flour<br>
½ teaspoon baking powder<br>
¼ cup chopped walnuts<br>
FOR THE FROSTING:<br>
3 ounce block of cream cheese, softened<br>
2 tablespoons butter, softened<br>
6 tablespoons powdered sugar<br>
¼ teaspoon vanilla<br>
Instructions<br>
Grease a 6” round cake pan with shortening or cooking spray. Preheat the oven to 350°.<br>
In a medium bowl, beat together with an electric mixer the canola oil and sugar. Beat very well, about 1 minute.<br>
Add the egg, cinnamon and vanilla and beat another 30 seconds. Beat in the carrot for about 15 seconds--you want it to break up a bit so it stains the batter orange. Sprinkle the flour and baking powder on top and beat until just combined. Do not over mix. You may stir in the walnuts at this point or save them for the frosting, your choice.<br>
Pour the batter into the pan, place it on a baking sheet, and bake for 24-26 minutes. Test for doneness with a toothpick before removing from the oven--moist crumbs clinging to the toothpick is ideal.<br>
Allow the cake to cool completely on a wire rack before attempting to frost it.<br>
To make the frosting, ensure all ingredients are room temperature or you will end up with lumps. Beat together everything with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Tip the cake out of the pan, place it on a serving plate upside down (so that you have a flat surface on top) and spread the frosting on the cake. Garnish with walnuts. This cake tastes even better if allowed to sit one day (in the fridge) before serving.<br>

Recipe Name:CLEAR TOY CANDY<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Ingredients<br>
1/2 cup clear corn syrup<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
Directions<br>
I try to use a ratio of two parts solid to one part liquid, but for your first batch use more liquid. It just takes longer and the liquid must boil off before it will reach the proper temperature so err on the side of too much liquid at first.<br>
In a pan put 1/2 cup of clear corn syrup, one cup of sugar, and put 1/2 cup of water on top of the sugar and make sure the sugar is thoroughly moistened. Stick in the candy thermometer and put the mixture on the stove.<br>
DO NOT STIR!<br>
Heat to 310 degrees and if you have the sugar thoroughly moistened it will look like boiling glass.<br>
If you have too much sugar for the liquid you used it will not be clear.<br>
When the mixture reaches 300-310 degrees, pour into molds generously coated with olive oil (any oil will work).<br>
Hold the molds together with heavy duty rubber bands and place the greased molds on a cookie sheet.<br>
If you don't have any molds, you can oil a cake pan and pour the mixture about 1/4 inch deep and score with a knife as it hardens so it will break into bite size pieces.<br>
Its takes about five minutes or so to harden in the molds and as it does I add sticks to make it easier to eat. I wrap them in small plastic bags which you can get wherever they sell candy making supplies.<br>
Remember you can't mess this up - if you put in too much corn syrup or water it will just take longer to reach the desired temperature. After your first batch, you'll never measure anything again.&nbsp;<br>

Recipe Name:Crisco's pie crust<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Crisco's recipe for SINGLE PIE CRUST<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
1 1/3 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 stick well-chilled Crisco® Baking Sticks All-Vegetable Shortening OR 1/2 cup well-chilled Crisco®&nbsp;<br>
All-Vegetable Shortening<br>
3 to 6 tablespoons ice cold water<br>
PREPARATION Directions for Crisco's  pie crust<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
1.  BLEND flour and salt in medium mixing bowl.<br>
2.  CUT chilled shortening into 1/2-inch cubes. Cut in chilled shortening cubes into flour mixture, using a pastry  blender, in an up and down chopping motion, until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some small pea-sized pieces remaining.<br>
3.  SPRINKLE half the maximum recommended amount of ice cold water (3 to 6 tablespoons ice cold water) over the flour mixture. Using a fork, stir and draw flour from bottom of bowl to the top, distributing moisture evenly into flour. Press chunks down to bottom of bowl with fork. Add more water by the tablespoon, until dough is moist enough to hold together when pressed together.<br>
TIP:Test dough for proper moistness by squeezing a marble-sized ball of dough in your hand. If it holds together firmly, do not add any additional water. If the dough crumbles, add more water by the tablespoonful, until dough is moist enough to form a smooth ball when pressed together.<br>
4.  SHAPE dough into a ball for single pie crust. Flatten ball into 1/2-inch thick round disk(s).<br>
TIP:For ease in rolling, wrap dough in plastic wrap. Chill for 30 minutes or up to 2 days.<br>
5.  ROLL dough from center outward with steady pressure on a lightly floured work surface (or between two sheets of wax or parchment paper) into a circle 2-inches wider than pie plate for the bottom crust.&nbsp;<br>
Transfer dough to pie plate by loosely rolling around rolling pin. Center the rolling pin over the pie&nbsp;<br>
plate, and then unroll, easing dough into pie plate.<br>
6.  Trim edges of dough leaving a 3/4-inch overhang. Fold edge under. Flute dough as desired. Bake according to specific recipe directions.<br>
* Mike's recipe for the crust<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
1/2 cup flour<br>
1 table spoon of Crisco (cold)<br>
Mix together adding up to 3-4-5 table spoons of cold water till doughy and just flatten out.&nbsp;<br>
The above crust recipe should be doubled in size and is not really enough to cover one pie glass.<br>
I noted on the Food Chanel that they add 3/4 tablespoon  of baking powder to make it flake.  Will try that.<br>

Recipe Name:Dana's Cherry Cheesecake<br>
11/01/2009<br>
The only special equipment you'll need to make one is a springform pan.  The 9 and 10 inch sizes are common.  Per Dana, if you don’t have that type of pan, you could just use a cake pan.&nbsp;<br>
Prep:20 minutes<br>
Cook:40 minutes<br>
Chill:8 hours<br>
Ingredients&nbsp;<br>
for graham cracker crust<br>
1 (5 1/3) ounce packet graham crackers, crushed (about 1 /2/3 cups)<br>
1/4 cup sugar<br>
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted.<br>
Directions<br>
Combine all ingredients, mixing well.  Firmly press crumb mixture evenly in bottom and up sides of a 9 inch pie plate.<br>
Bake crust at 350 degrees for 7 to 9 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack.  Yields:8 servings.<br>
Ingredients&nbsp;<br>
for cheese part of cake<br>
3 8 ounce packages crème cheese, softened<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
3 large eggs<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
Directions<br>
Beat cream cheese at high speed with an electric mixer until creamy; gradually add 1 cup sugar, beating well.<br>
Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.<br>
Stir in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Our int prepared crust.<br>
Bake at 350 degrees of 35 minutes or until cheesecake is set<br>
When I make these recipes I substitute a product called “Splenda for Baking” in place of the sugar. It’s in the baking aisle of the grocery store. Read the directions on the package because it is not a 1-cup for 1-cup replacement. You actually use less of the Splenda for Baking than what the recipe calls for for sugar. For the cherry topping, I used a lite cherry pie filling – the label said “no added sugar”.&nbsp;<br>

Recipe Name:Pineapple USD Cake 4<br>
08/25/2014<br>
1/2/2014 8<br>
Ingredients<br>
1/2 ripe medium pineapple, peeled, cored, eyes removed and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds (about 4 or 5 slices)<br>
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter<br>
3/4 cup light brown sugar<br>
14 pecan halves<br>
1 cup cake flour (not self-rising)<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1 cup granulated sugar<br>
2 eggs<br>
1 cup buttermilk<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
1 tablespoon dark rum<br>
4 fresh cherries, halved and pits removed<br>
Directions<br>
Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet, over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until the sugar mixture is bubbly, about 2 minutes. Arrange pineapple slices in the skillet in a pleasing pattern and continue to cook for 2 minutes, or until the sugar mixture turns an amber color. Turn the pineapple slices over and remove the pan from the heat. (The mixture will continue to cook even though the heat is off.) Arrange the pecan halves in the spaces between the rings. Set aside to cool slightly.<br>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.<br>
Stir together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl.<br>
In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the remaining 1/2 cup butter and the granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing just until incorporated. Add the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately in 3 batches, mixing at low speed after each addition until just combined. Stir in the vanilla and rum.<br>
Spoon the batter evenly over the pineapple slices in the skillet. Bake in the middle of the oven until golden brown and a tester comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.<br>
Cool the cake in the skillet on a wire rack for 4 minutes only. Run a thin knife around the edge of the cake and, wearing oven mitts and working quickly, invert the cake onto a cake plate, keeping plate and skillet firmly pressed together. Carefully lift the skillet off cake and replace any fruit stuck to the bottom of the skillet, if necessary. Arrange the fresh cherry halves, cut side down, into the top of the cake, in the center of the pineapple rings.<br>
Serve cake warm or at room temperature.<br>

1/2 of a medium yellow onion, chopped<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 cups half and half (or 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream)<br>
3 cups chicken stock<br>
1/4 cup corn starch<br>
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
1 large carrot, peeled and chopped small<br>
4 cups broccoli florets (about 1 head)<br>
2 1/2 cups grated cheddar cheese (about 8 ounces)<br>
Salt and Pepper to taste<br>
Bread Bowls ingredients/recipe at bottom<br>
directions<br>
Cook the butter, onion, and garlic on about medium heat until tender.&nbsp;<br>
Slowly add the half and half and chicken stock. Mix the corn starch with a little bit of water until there are no clumps and add it to the rest. Add the nutmeg and bay leaves and cook on medium low until thickened.<br>
Add the carrot and broccoli and simmer until tender. Discard the bay leaves. Add the cheese and stir until melted. Season with salt and pepper and serve in bread bowls.&nbsp;<br>
Note: In the old post, I pureed it. You can do that if you want.<br>
ingredients<br>
Bread Bowl&nbsp;<br>
1 1/2 cups warm water (Between 105ºF and 115ºF, hot enough to keep your finger in comfortably)<br>
2 tablespoons instant dry yeast<br>
1 tablespoon white sugar<br>
3 1/2 cups bread flour<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
A spray bottle<br>
Directions<br>
Combine the water and yeast. Let sit for a couple minutes. Add the sugar and flour and knead for 10 minutes by hand or with stand mixer with dough hook attachment. Add the salt.&nbsp;<br>
Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about half and hour.&nbsp;<br>
Preheat the oven to 500ºF. Divide the dough into three lumps. Stretch each one into a tight ball, pinching the bottom with your fingers and sealing it off by twisting it on the counter.&nbsp;<br>
Place on a greased baking sheet. Score the top and sprinkle with some salt. Spray with a spray bottle of water and allow to rise 15 more minutes.&nbsp;<br>
Place in the oven. After 2 minutes, open the oven, spray the bread bowls with the spray bottle and turn the heat to 425ºF. Continue to bake 18 more minutes or until done.<br>
To cut the bread bowls, use a knife to cut a circle directly downwards, then pull it out.&nbsp;<br>

1 lb. crabmeat (no shells)<br>
1 1/2 cup diced onion<br>
1 cup diced celery<br>
3/4 cup shredded carrots<br>
1 medium diced green pepper<br>
1 tablespoon chopped parsley<br>
2 cups chicken broth<br>
1 bottle clam juice<br>
2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning<br>
2 tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce<br>
2 quarts Half and Half<br>
1/4 lb. butter<br>
1 cup flour<br>
Salt and pepper to taste<br>
Mike, use the yellow pot which will just barely hold all ot the contents.<br>
In a 6 quart pot /\ add chicken broth, clam juice and vegetables and bring to a boil and boil for 1/2 hour.&nbsp;<br>
Add crab meat, Old Bay and  Worcestershire sauce.  Stir together.<br>
While soup is reheating, melt butter in large pan and add flour.&nbsp;<br>
MY CHANGE TO THIS RECIPE, AS I ENDED UP WITH A LOT OF CLUMPS!<br>
GRADUALLY add and MIX the Half and Half to butter/flour mixture (LOW HEAT) till it is mixed well and is thickened.  Gradually add rue to soup and stir.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br>
I think some mushrooms and possibly bacon and a 1/4 teaspoon of Cumin might be good in it too, as well as some shrimp.  Makes about 4 quarts.<br>

Recipe Name:Mike's Chicken Corn Soup<br>
06/09/2013<br>
7/2/2014 1<br>
1 can Swanson chicken broth<br>
3 strips of chicken<br>
1 chicken bullion cube<br>
Poultry seasoning<br>
1 egg<br>
Parsley<br>
Saffron<br>
1 can small whole corn or fresh corn<br>
Butter<br>
Boil 1 egg for 20 minutes (hard boil it) and dice it up.<br>
Bring Swanson chicken broth to a boil. Add 1 chicken bullion cube and 1 cup of water.<br>
Keep at low boil.<br>
Cut chicken into line 1/2" pieces and fry in olive oil, not till brown, but till not pink.<br>
Fry it with some poultry seasoning shaken on.  1/2 teaspoon.<br>
Remove the chicken from the fry pan and cut into smaller pieces and add to the boiling "Swanson chicken broth with the 1 chicken bullion cube with a cup of water" mixture.<br>
Add the hard boiled egg.<br>
Add 2 tablespoons of butter.<br>
Add saffron, don't ask how much.. just enough :)<br>
Add teaspoon of Parsley.<br>
Let all of it simmer for like 3/4 hour.  Longer might make it better?&nbsp;<br>
that's it..<br>
It really surprised me! It didn't start out looking too good, but started to smell really good and it turned out it was.&nbsp;<br>
It would of been much better if I had used fresh corn rather than a can of corn.  There was actually too much chicken&nbsp;<br>
it it.  And there should of been more that 1 small can or corn in it.  I did NOT add any salt of pepper to it while it was&nbsp;<br>
cooking.<br>

Recipe Name:MUSHROOM SOUP<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Total Time:55 min<br>
Prep:15 min<br>
Cook:40 min<br>
Yield:4 servings<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 pound firm white mushrooms, cleaned<br>
1 medium lemon<br>
1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br>
2 tablespoons minced shallots<br>
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme<br>
1/2 bay leaf<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper<br>
2 cups heavy cream<br>
1 1/2 cups chicken stock<br>
1 teaspoon cornstarch, dissolved in 1 tablespoon of water<br>
1 tablespoon minced parsley<br>
Directions<br>
Sprinkle the mushrooms with lemon juice.<br>
In a food processor, coarsely chop them.<br>
Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan and lightly sauté the shallots.&nbsp;<br>
Add the mushrooms, thyme, and bay leaf and sauté over moderate heat for 10 minutes, or until the liquid disappears.&nbsp;<br>
Add the salt, pepper, cream, and chicken stock and bring to a boil.&nbsp;<br>
Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.<br>
Add the cornstarch to the soup and continue to simmer 10 minutes longer, stirring constantly. Correct seasoning to taste.<br>
Serve in warm bowls. Sprinkle with minced parsley.<br>
This was ok but not great.  It didn't have a lot of taste.  I did notice where "sauté over moderate heat for 10 minutes or until the liquid disappears" didn't happen, as the liquid remained... maybe I should of waiting longer, which may also have make it more flavorful?  Also, the one teaspoon of cornstarch did not seem to thicken up the soup that much.  I think it might have been better using flour instead of the cornstarch for more flavor.  Adding Nutmeg seemed to help it as did some Savory.<br>

Pennsylvania Dutch Chicken Corn Soup<br>
makes 12 servings<br>
2  (3 pound) whole chickens, cut into pieces<br>
3 quarts water<br>
3 onions, minced<br>
1 cup chopped celery<br>
2 1/2 tablespoons salt<br>
1 1/4 teaspoons ground nutmeg<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
10 ears fresh corn<br>
3 eggs<br>
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour<br>
1/2 cup milk<br>
In a large pot over medium heat, combine chicken, water, onions, celery, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 2 hours, adding water as needed, until chicken is very tender. Remove the chicken from the soup. Refrigerate chicken and soup.<br>
When fat solidifies on surface of soup, remove from refrigerator and remove fat. Remaining soup should equal about 2 1/2 quarts.<br>
Remove corn from cobs by splitting kernels lengthwise with a sharp knife and scraping corn from cob. Combine soup and corn in a large pot over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until corn is tender, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
Meanwhile, place two of the eggs in a small saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Set aside.<br>
Chop cooled chicken meat and add to soup.<br>
In a medium bowl, beat remaining egg until light in color. Beat in flour and milk until smooth. Drop batter by partial spoonful's into hot broth to make small (1/4 -1/2 inch round) dumplings. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 5 minutes, until dumplings hold their shape and float to the surface. Stir in reserved cooked egg.<br>

Recipe Name:PEPPERONI &amp; MOZZARELLA STUFFED CHICKEN BREASTS<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Pepperoni &amp; Mozzarella Stuffed Chicken Breasts<br>
recipe from Sandi Endy<br>
INGREDIENTS:<br>
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br>
2 oz. mozzarella cheese<br>
1.25 oz. (approx. 16 slices) pepperoni<br>
1 large egg<br>
1/2 cup all purpose flour<br>
1/2 cup bread crumbs<br>
6 Tbsps vegetable oil<br>
to taste salt and pepper<br>
Directions<br>
STEP 1: Trim the chicken breasts. Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces.&nbsp;<br>
Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in.<br>
STEP 2: Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside.<br>
STEP 3: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp. of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third (Pampered Chef Coating Trays would be great for this). Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp. of water helps break it up).<br>
STEP 4: One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating.<br>
STEP 5: Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and you’ll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden&nbsp;<br>
brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes.<br>
STEP 6: When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven.<br>
Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces). Remove from the oven (check to make sure the chicken is cooked through) and serve immediately!<br>

Recipe Name:POTATO SOUP SANDI<br>
08/31/2015<br>
THE BEST potato soup recipe ever!<br>
Ingredients:<br>
2 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes, sliced into small bite sized pieces<br>
1/2 regular package uncooked bacon, finely diced<br>
1 medium onion, diced<br>
1/4 bunch celery, diced<br>
8 cups milk<br>
4 cups water<br>
4 chicken bullion cubes (use a cup of the hot potato water to dissolve, then use the cup of hot water in place<br>
of one of the above cups of water)<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon black pepper<br>
3/4 cup salted butter<br>
3/4 cup flour<br>
1/4 bunch freshly chopped parsley<br>
1 cup whipping cream<br>
***For garnish:***<br>
Shredded cheese<br>
fried bacon bits<br>
chopped green onions<br>
Directions:<br>
In large pot, boil potatoes in water 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. In sauté pan, cook bacon until crisp.&nbsp;<br>
Drain bacon fat and place on paper towel over plate to drain more. Add onion and celery to bacon pan over medium-high heat until celery is tender, about 5 minutes. To the large potato pan, add milk, water, bullion, salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture is very hot, about 8 minutes, stirring often. Do not let mixture boil. In small, heavy saucepan melt butter. Add flour and mix well.&nbsp;<br>
Cook over medium-low heat until mixture bubbles, stirring 2 to 3 minutes to make a roux. While&nbsp;<br>
constantly stirring soup, add roux slowly until soup is thick and creamy, about 4 minutes. Stir in&nbsp;<br>
parsley, reserved potatoes, and cream. Garnish with cheese, bacon bits, onions or all three. Serve hot!<br>
I made the potato soup today (6/21/14) and it wasn't bad, but wasn't all that great either.  Maybe after refrigerating overnight and reheating it up it might be better??  I added hardboiled eggs to it and saffron also.<br>

Recipe Name:TOMATO BASIL SOUP<br>
01/29/2016<br>
ingredients<br>
3 lbs Roma (plum) tomatoes, rinsed, cut in half lengthwise and seeded<br>
2 cups sliced yellow onions<br>
6 garlic cloves, minced<br>
2 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br>
1 quart (32 oz.) low-sodium chicken broth<br>
1 cup fresh basil, chopped<br>
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
6 Tablespoons shredded Asiago cheese<br>
steps<br>
Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss tomatoes, onions, garlic and olive oil together. Spread tomato mixture on a non-stick baking sheet and roast for 45 minutes.<br>
Remove baking sheet from oven. Once cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skins from the tomatoes. Transfer the tomato mixture to a large stockpot over medium heat, along with any juices.<br>
Add salt, crushed red pepper flakes, broth, basil, thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and then simmer uncovered for about 30 minutes.<br>
Discard the bay leaves. Puree soup in batches in a blender or food processor for a smooth, creamy consistency. Garnish each serving with 1 tablespoon Asiago cheese.<br>
Serve immediately.<br>
Tip: To seed the tomatoes, simply cut in half lengthwise and squeeze out the seeds. Don’t worry about crushing the tomatoes – you’ll be pureeing them anyway.<br>

Recipe Name:VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP LIKE MOMS?<br>
12/10/2012<br>
Mike said; I think this is pretty close to what Mom used to make<br>
Servings 4-6<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 lb beef stew meat<br>
1 onion<br>
3 celery ribs<br>
1 Small, head Green Cabbage, sliced; optional&nbsp;<br>
10 baby carrots (or a couple regular carrots)<br>
2 potatoes (peeled if you like)<br>
1 cup frozen corn<br>
1 cup frozen peas<br>
2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes (I use salt-free)<br>
3 1/2 cups beef broth (or 2 14-oz. cans)<br>
2 small bay leaves<br>
2 teaspoons garlic powder<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil (or any cooking oil)<br>
4 cups water<br>
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce<br>
Directions<br>
Cut meat into small, bite-size (1/2") pieces.<br>
In a large pot or dutch oven, sauté meat in 1 T oil on medium-high heat until all sides are brown.<br>
Set aside on a plate.<br>
Chop celery, onion, potatoes, and carrots into bite-size pieces.<br>
Sauté celery and onion in remaining 1 T oil until onion is golden (about 10 minutes).<br>
Add browned beef, water, broth, tomatoes with juices, carrots, potatoes, corn, bay leaves and garlic.<br>
Bring to a boil.<br>
Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until beef is almost tender, about an hour.<br>
Add peas and hot sauce to soup.<br>
Cover and simmer until beef is tender, about 30 minutes longer.<br>
Serve and season with freshly ground black pepper, hot sauce, or crumbled saltines, if desired.<br>
This recipe was FAIR.  I used Dominico garlic and basil diced tomatoes and I should of used whole tomatoes and cut them up.  The Dominico garlic and basic diced tomatoes were chunks and the whole tomatoes cut up would of been more loose.<br>

Recipe Name: BREAD BASIC HOMEMADE<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast<br>
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)<br>
3 tablespoons sugar<br>
1 tablespoon salt<br>
2 tablespoons canola oil<br>
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
Directions<br>
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.<br>
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.<br>
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. Shape each into a loaf. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes.<br>
Bake at 375° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Yield: 2 loaves (16 slices each).&nbsp;<br>
NOTE:I baked it for 35 minutes and I think it could of been baked a bit longer... maybe 5 minutes.  It looked a bit doughy in the middle.<br>

Drain meat mixture and return to heat.<br>
Add in tomato sauce, undrained dice tomatoes and the puree diced tomatoes.<br>
Stir in chicken broth and brown sugar.<br>
Let sauce simmer for 30-45 minutes or until liquid is reduced and sauce thickens.<br>
Season generously with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, parsley, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.<br>
Taste, taste, taste after each seasoning until the sauce tastes perfect!<br>
Set aside on a back burner over low heat to keep warm.<br>
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.<br>
Break thin spaghetti noodles in half and cook until al dente about 6-7 minutes. Do not overcook.<br>
Drain pasta and return to pot.<br>

Prep time 30 mins<br>
Cook time 25 mins<br>
Total time 55 mins<br>
Yield: 5 - 6 servings<br>
Ingredients<br>
2 tablespoon graded cheese<br>
1 tablespoon chopped up Jalapenos peppers<br>
8 oz. (1/2 pound or about 1¾ cups) macaroni or other medium tubular pasta (like penne or conchiglie)<br>
3 tablespoons butter<br>
¼ cup flour<br>
½ teaspoon salt<br>
½ teaspoon dry mustard<br>
¼ teaspoon black pepper<br>
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika plus more for sprinkling on top<br>
2½ cups 2% milk<br>
3 cups grated medium cheddar cheese*<br>
1  tablespoon cracker crumbs.<br>
1 small link of smoked sausage OR hot dogs<br>
1 egg<br>
Instructions<br>
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.<br>
Boil the pasta until al dente, according to package directions.&nbsp;<br>
Drain and rinse with cool water to stop the cooking, and return to the pan you boiled it in.&nbsp;<br>
Set aside. (Mix in a little butter to keep the noodles from sticking if it's going to be awhile before you make the sauce).<br>
Over medium heat, melt the butter.<br>
Add the flour, salt, dry mustard, pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika.&nbsp;<br>
Stir constantly over medium heat for about three minutes.<br>
Add the egg to milk and beat until blended.<br>
Stir in the milk, with egg, to the mixture.<br>
Keeping on medium heat, whisk constantly for about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens.<br>
Remove from heat, and stir in 2 cups of the cheese, stirring until melted.<br>
Pour the cheese sauce over the noodles and toss gently until all noodles are covered.&nbsp;<br>
Add sliced smoked sausage and add to a two quart casserole dish.<br>
Sprinkle top with graded cheese, chopped Jalapenos peppers, and cracker crumbs and dust lightly with the smoked paprika.<br>
Bake for about 25-30 minutes, until it starts getting a slightly dry and a tiny bit brown on top.&nbsp;<br>
Serve, topping individual servings with cooked, chopped bacon if desired.<br>
Pop, for a few minutes under the broiler, to seal in flavor and get the top brown and crunchy.<br>
Can try other type of cheeses?? Asiago cheese?<br>
One of the things I don't like about this recipe is that once it is done it is very runny.  I'd like it to be firmer, which I'm guessing means adding eggs to it?<br>

1 small onion (sweet onion)<br>
1 lb. hamburg<br>
3 clove garlic<br>
1/2 cup minced green pepper<br>
1/2 cup cut celery<br>
2 10 1/2 oz. canned tomato puree (actually 1 can is 28 oz., so use other 7 oz. for something else)<br>
2 1 lb. canned tomatoes (whole)<br>
2 6 oz. tomato paste<br>
1 can mushrooms<br>
1 teaspoon sage<br>
1/4 teaspoon thyme<br>
1/4 teaspoon oregano<br>
1 tablespoon rosemary<br>
1 bay leaf<br>
1 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground up clove powder<br>
2 tablespoons of butter (just tried adding this 2/3/15 as saw in another spaghetti sauce recipe and this sauce I made, on 2/3/15, was the closest to mom's I've every made!)<br>
OK, I was talking to Millie about Mom's spaghetti sauce and she spoke about the 1/4 tsp. of cloves it in.  I said what?? and sure enough in ONE of mom's spaghetti sauce recopies there IS an ingredient of 1/4 tsp. of ground up cloves!  So, try adding it to the recipe the next time I make it.  I'm making Mom's spaghetti sauce today (4/9/14) and I tried the sauce before I put the 1/4 teaspoon of ground up cloves in it and after I put in a 1/4 teaspoon of ground up cloves in it and....  It did have a slightly better "moms spaghetti" sauce tang!<br>
Sauté onions and celery in fat until tender. Add the Hamburg and brown. Add all the tomatoes and sauces<br>
then the seasonings. Add green pepper last. Simmer about 3 hours, stir occasionally.<br>
Makes about 10 cups/80 ounces<br>

01/25/2016<br>
Prep 30 m<br>
Cook 2 h 30 m<br>
Ready In 3 h 15 m<br>
1 pound sweet Italian sausage<br>
3/4 pound lean ground beef<br>
1/2 cup minced onion<br>
2 cloves garlic, crushed<br>
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes<br>
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste<br>
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
2 tablespoons white sugar<br>
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves<br>
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds<br>
Directions<br>
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.<br>
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.<br>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br>
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.<br>
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.<br>

Recipe Name:Banana bread<br>
07/06/2015<br>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br>
Cook time: 1 hour<br>
Yield: Makes one loaf<br>
No need for a mixer for this recipe! Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one bowl.<br>
The best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside  squishy and browning.<br>
Ingredients<br>
2-3 very ripe bananas, peeled<br>
1/3 cup melted butter<br>
1 cup of sugar (or brown sugar)(can easily use 3/4 cup, or drop it down to 1/2 cup if you want it less sweet)<br>
1 egg, beaten<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour<br>
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.<br>
In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.<br>
Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.<br>
Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes (check at 50 minutes) at 350°F (175°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.<br>
Remove from oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove the banana bread from the pan. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)<br>
was not bad! I think adding some walnuts to it would go a long way in making it better. and possibly 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.<br>

Recipe Name:BEST-EVER PIZZA DOUGH<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Ingredients<br>
1 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees )<br>
1 teaspoon honey<br>
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast<br>
3 cups (or more) all-purpose or bread flour<br>
1 3/4 teaspoons coarse salt<br>
2 tablespoons EVOO, plus more for oiling bowl<br>
Directions<br>
Mix the warm water and honey in a liquid measuring cup until the honey dissolves. Sprinkle with the yeast and let the mixture stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, using a food processor, pulse the flour and salt to mix.<br>
Pour the yeast mixture and 2 tbsp. EVOO over the flour mixture. Process until the dough comes together in a sticky ball, about 20 to 30 seconds.<br>
Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead, using the heel of your hand, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.<br>
Lightly oil a large bowl; add the dough, turning to coat. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough stand in a warm, draft-free area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.<br>
Punch the dough down, then turn onto a cutting board. Using a knife, quarter the dough.<br>
Shape 1 dough wedge roughly into a ball. Place the dough ball on the work surface and cup your hand lightly over it. Rotate your hand counterclockwise, letting the dough roll on the work surface. Continue until the surface of the dough is smooth. Repeat with the remaining dough wedges.<br>
Place each dough ball in a large resealable plastic bag or plastic container with a lid. Refrigerate for 10 to 48 hours (the dough will continue to rise). Let the dough sit at room temperature for 1 hour before shaping, or freeze for up to 2 weeks. Let the frozen dough sit at room temperature for 2 hours before shaping.<br>
Turn out 1 ball of dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Press it out on the work surface into a 9-inch round, a long rectangle or an oval. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. To make 3- to 4-inch mini pizzas, cut each dough ball into 4 pieces, then press or stretch into shape.<br>

Recipe Name:CRACKERS AT HOME<br>
11/01/2009<br>
Ingredients<br>
3 cups all-purpose flour, or a mix of all-purpose and whole grain flours<br>
2 teaspoons sugar<br>
2 teaspoons salt<br>
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>
1 cup water<br>
Optional topping: 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, 1 tablespoon poppy seeds, 1 teaspoon sea salt&nbsp;<br>
Instructions<br>
Heat the oven to 450°F: Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 450°F. Sprinkle a baking sheet lightly with flour and set aside.<br>
Mix together the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt.<br>
Add the oil and water: Add the oil and water to the flour mixture. Stir until a soft, sticky dough is formed. If a lot of loose flour remains in the bottom of the bowl and the surface of the dough, add more water a tablespoon at a time until all the flour is incorporated.<br>
Divide and shape the dough into a square: Divide the dough into two halves and set one half aside. Sprinkle your work surface lightly with flour and set the other half on top. Pat it into a thick square with your hands.<br>
Roll out the dough: Working from the center of the dough out, roll the dough into a rectangle roughly 1/8-inch thick or thinner. If the dough starts to shrink back as you roll it, let it rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes and then continue rolling.<br>
Sprinkle dough with topping (optional): Brush the surface of the dough very lightly with water. Combine the seeds in a small bowl and sprinkle half of them (roughly 1 1/2 tablespoons) evenly over the surface of the dough.&nbsp;<br>
Cut the dough into cracker-sized rectangles: Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, cut the dough into individual crackers roughly 1-inch by 2-inches. Alternatively, cut the crackers into squares, diamonds, or use cookie cutters.<br>
Transfer crackers to baking sheet and prick with fork: Transfer the crackers to the baking sheet using a metal dough scraper or spatula. It's fine to crowd the crackers very close to each other. Prick each cracker with the tines of a fork to prevent them from puffing during baking.<br>
Bake the crackers in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until the edges are browned. Thinner crackers will bake more quickly than thicker ones; you can remove the crackers as they brown to your liking and continue baking the rest.&nbsp;<br>
Cool and store the crackers: Transfer the baked crackers to a wire rack to cool completely. The crackers will crisp further as they cool. Store the crackers in an airtight container on the counter for 3-5 days. If you're crackers are a little old and less-than-crispy, lay them on a baking sheet and put them in a 350°F oven for a few minutes to re-crisp.<br>

Recipe Name:GARLIC ROASTER<br>
11/20/2013<br>
Roasting garlic makes it soft, spreadable and makes it taste mild yet flavorful. It is a tasty additive to any meal, appetizer, or even just as a snack. It can be spread on bread or crackers, mixed into vegetables and sauces, spread over meats or eat with a fork straight from the clove. Garlic is very low-calorie and healthy. Don't let your garlic roaster collect dust in the back of a cupboard. Put it to good use and make some roasted garlic today.<br>
Instructions<br>
1 Slice off the pointy end of your bulb of garlic so that you've cut off just the tips of each clove, so the inside of each clove is exposed. Remove any loose, excess peel but keep the bulb intact.<br>
2 Place your garlic, cut side up, on your clay or enamel garlic roaster. Drizzle the bulb with approximately one tablespoon of olive oil. If you're worried about eating light or low-calorie, about a teaspoon of oil will do. Brush it on with a pastry or sauce brush to ensure even coverage. Some oil is necessary to promote browning, but if you are very conscious about using oil you can just give the top of the garlic a spray with an olive oil flavored non-stick cooking spray.<br>
3 Place the top on your garlic roaster and put it into the rack in the center of a cold oven. Don't place a cold clay roaster into a hot over, or you risk it cracking or shattering from the sudden temperature change. Allow the oven to heat up with the vessel inside of it.<br>
4 Set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the garlic in for about an hour.<br>
5 With an oven mitt, remove the cover and set it down on the rack. Test for doneness by scooping out one of the cloves with a fork. It should be brown, translucent, soft and spreadable when it is done. If it's not done, cover it and allow it to heat for 15 to 30 more minutes.<br>
6 Remove your garlic, replace the lid on the roaster, turn off your oven, and leave your garlic roaster to cool down with the oven. Do not place a clay garlic roaster or the cover on a cold counter or into a cold sink, or run it under cold water. Again, sudden temperature fluctuations will cause it to crack or shatter.<br>

Recipe Name:Knepp<br>
07/20/2014<br>
Ingredients:<br>
2 eggs (free range organic eggs are best)<br>
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour<br>
1 tbs of olive oil or butter<br>
1. Put the flour in a mixing bowl.<br>
2. Break eggs and put in another bowl (be sure and put the egg shells in the compost and not in the bowl, which I did once.).<br>
3. Lightly beat with a fork the eggs.<br>
4. Stir the eggs into the flour until all the flour is moist. The flour and egg mixture will be gummy, and gooey.<br>
5. Put on a medium pan of water, salt and bring to a boil.<br>
6. Take a tablespoon of the egg flour mixture and drop it into the boiling water. Repeat until all the mixture is gone. (use your finger to push the mixture off the spoon one at a time, into water.)<br>
7. Let the little dumplings boil in the water for about 10 minutes. Then take them out with a draining spoon, getting the water off of them. You can pour the water and dumplings into a strainer also.<br>
8. Using a fry pan, put in the oil or butter and heat until melted or warm. Use a medium heat.<br>
9. Put the dumplings into the pan, frying them slowly and lightly, turning them, until they are golden brown.<br>
10. Serve….<br>

Recipe Name:SALTINE CRACKERS<br>
01/20/2015<br>
ingredients<br>
2 c. flour<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
2/3 c. milk<br>
2 tbsp. butter<br>
1/2 tsp. baking soda<br>
1 teaspoon cracked up Fennel seeds<br>
directions<br>
Combine the dry ingredients, cut in the butter, then stir in the milk. Round into a ball and knead for few strokes. Divide dough into several pieces and roll out very thin on a floured board. Lay sheets on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with salt and cracked Fennel seeds and prick with a fork. Cut into 1 1/2 inch squares with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned.<br>
Not bad!  but definitely needs to be baked more then 12 minutes... more like 19 or 20 (or perhaps a higher oven temperature?) to get brown and crackery consistency.  Mine were a but mushey in the middle and weren't browned and that was after like 18 minutes.<br>
